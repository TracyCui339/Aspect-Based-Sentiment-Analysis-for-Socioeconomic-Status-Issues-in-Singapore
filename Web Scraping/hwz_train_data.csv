clearly it will because it s a tough time with rising costs and economic uncertainties,  said the professor of finance, economics and real estate at the nus business school. some businesses may have to pass on these costs to consumers, he added. deloitte singapore s tax partner yap hsien yew described the announcement as possibly being  a financial burden  for businesses, especially small- and medium-size enterprises (smes) which may not have the same access to cash flow and healthy profits as larger corporations. beyond financial metrics, the impact on smes will also differ depending on the industry. those that employ more higher-income workers will feel the heat, said the association of small and medium enterprises (asme). this group will likely involve smes in industries such as technology and professional services such as accounting and auditing.  in other sectors like retail, most of the workers employed by smes are between the salary range of s$2,500 to $$4,000, which means they will not be affected in the near term,  said the association's vice-president ang yuit. phased increase to cushion impact   the phased increase in the cpf monthly salary ceiling will help cushion the impact on employers, both asme and the singapore national employers federation (snef) said. this will allow employers to ""gradually adjust and factor this increase"" into their business costs against the backdrop of slower economic growth, rising costs and a tight labour market, added snef, which has more than 3,400 members. the cpf annual salary ceiling has also been left unchanged for now, said prof agarwal, noting that this will also mitigate the impact on businesses. mr christopher gee, a senior research fellow and head of the governance and economy department at the institute of policy studies, estimates that the change in the monthly salary ceiling, when fully implemented by 2026, will result in an increase of s$2 billion to s$2.5 billion in labour costs annually . this increase would need to be offset by productivity gains to ensure it is sustainable for businesses and their workers in the long run, he wrote in a commentary. deloitte's mr yap said employers should view the announcement as helping to build a more financially secure workforce, which ultimately benefits them in the long run.  while the increase may be a financial burden in the short term, it is an investment that businesses should consider in order to reap the long-term benefits of having a financially secure and experienced workforce,  he told cna. it was also announced in budget 2023 that the government will continue with the next increase in cpf contribution rates for older workers , following the first two steps of increases in 2022 and 2023. from next year, the total cpf contribution rates for workers aged 56 to 60 and 61 to 65 will go up by 1.5 percentage points to 31 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively. the contribution rate for workers aged 66 to 70 will rise by 1 percentage point to 16.5 per cent. to mitigate the rise in business costs, employers will get a one-year offset that is equivalent to half of the 2024 increase in employer contribution rates for every singaporean and permanent resident they employ aged 56 to 70. 'a financial burden': higher cpf salary ceiling will add to businesses' woes, say associations and experts the increase in the cpf salary ceiling means that those who earn more than s$6,000   and their employers   will soon have to contribute more towards their retirement savings. www.channelnewsasia.com",2023/2/16 10:42,central provident fund,TRUE,FALSE,"singapore: the raising of the $T$ (cpf) monthly salary ceiling will add to the woes of companies already grappling with increasing costs, said business associations and experts",-1

retirement, says david kuo of the smart investor. commentary: singapore residents must save for retirement today to continue enjoying low income taxes for direct taxes to remain low, singapore workers need to do more with their money to prepare for their future retirement, says david kuo of the smart investor. www.channelnewsasia.com singapore: the message from the budget 2023 speech could not have been clearer. it cannot be business as usual for singapore. over the last couple of decades, the country has benefited from global trade and finance flows. but with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. as the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. by 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. budget 2023 offers targeted support to singapore s growing pool of seniors . the eldercare fund will be topped up by s$500 million, and another s$1.5 billion will be added to the medifund. but just think about that for a moment. singapore expects a budget deficit of s$2 billion in the financial year (fy) of 2022, and a deficit of s$400 million in fy2023. those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. that is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. if we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won t need government subsidies. ensuring our retirement adequacy  as singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that singapore workers can do for themselves now. while the government has kept the rate of contributions to the central provident fund (cpf) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from s$6,000 to s$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . but this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. if so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. this number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. a 2019 lee kuan yew school of public policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in singapore is about s$1,400 a month. but considering that the median income per household member in singapore is about s$3,200 a month, which adds up to s$38,400 per year, let s work off a round figure of s$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. you can scale this up or down accordingly, but don t forget to factor in inflation. at an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our s$50,000 target would be equivalent to s$100,000 in around 24 years  time. and in 48 years  time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. that, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. that is the income we would need to generate from our savings. because we don t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the cpf special account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of s$100,000 a year in 24 years  time is s$2.5 million. we should ask ourselves if our accumulated cpf contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. if it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. that generally means investing in shares. there is a limit as to how much our cpf money can be invested in the stock market. so, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of cpf. the best time to do that is while we are young. indirect taxes prevail over direct taxes  budget 2023 also highlighted the government s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. so too will taxes on luxury cars . we can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. in the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. in the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. however, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. the upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the government to redistribute wealth. after all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. it is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. setting aside money for the next crisis  there was another important message in the budget. while the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. though singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year s budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. what s more, singapore must continue to consciously build up its reserves to prepare for the next crisis. we need to do the same too. the government has provided singaporeans with the means to cope with inflationary pressures through voucher schemes . this should help ease some of the pain when we do our daily shopping. more importantly, it buys us time to set aside some money for a rainy day because wages are rising but income tax rates aren t. it is a window of opportunity that other developed economies have been unable to provide. but we need to fix our roofs when the sun is shining. it will be too late when thunderstorms hit. in summary, budget 2023 puts households firmly in the driving seat. the government is treating people as mature adults in a maturing economy. the country s finances are strong and should be even stronger over time. we too can make our household finances stronger over time by being prudent with our spending and preparing for future uncertainties. if we want our taxes to remain

clearly it will because it s a tough time with rising costs and economic uncertainties,  said the professor of finance, economics and real estate at the nus business school. some businesses may have to pass on these costs to consumers, he added. deloitte singapore s tax partner yap hsien yew described the announcement as possibly being  a financial burden  for businesses, especially small- and medium-size enterprises (smes) which may not have the same access to cash flow and healthy profits as larger corporations. beyond financial metrics, the impact on smes will also differ depending on the industry. those that employ more higher-income workers will feel the heat, said the association of small and medium enterprises (asme). this group will likely involve smes in industries such as technology and professional services such as accounting and auditing.  in other sectors like retail, most of the workers employed by smes are between the salary range of s$2,500 to $$4,000, which means they will not be affected in the near term,  said the association's vice-president ang yuit. phased increase to cushion impact   the phased increase in the cpf monthly salary ceiling will help cushion the impact on employers, both asme and the singapore national employers federation (snef) said. this will allow employers to ""gradually adjust and factor this increase"" into their business costs against the backdrop of slower economic growth, rising costs and a tight labour market, added snef, which has more than 3,400 members. the cpf annual salary ceiling has also been left unchanged for now, said prof agarwal, noting that this will also mitigate the impact on businesses. mr christopher gee, a senior research fellow and head of the governance and economy department at the institute of policy studies, estimates that the change in the monthly salary ceiling, when fully implemented by 2026, will result in an increase of s$2 billion to s$2.5 billion in labour costs annually . this increase would need to be offset by productivity gains to ensure it is sustainable for businesses and their workers in the long run, he wrote in a commentary. deloitte's mr yap said employers should view the announcement as helping to build a more financially secure workforce, which ultimately benefits them in the long run.  while the increase may be a financial burden in the short term, it is an investment that businesses should consider in order to reap the long-term benefits of having a financially secure and experienced workforce,  he told cna. it was also announced in budget 2023 that the government will continue with the next increase in cpf contribution rates for older workers , following the first two steps of increases in 2022 and 2023. from next year, the total cpf contribution rates for workers aged 56 to 60 and 61 to 65 will go up by 1.5 percentage points to 31 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively. the contribution rate for workers aged 66 to 70 will rise by 1 percentage point to 16.5 per cent. to mitigate the rise in business costs, employers will get a one-year offset that is equivalent to half of the 2024 increase in employer contribution rates for every singaporean and permanent resident they employ aged 56 to 70. 'a financial burden': higher cpf salary ceiling will add to businesses' woes, say associations and experts the increase in the cpf salary ceiling means that those who earn more than s$6,000   and their employers   will soon have to contribute more towards their retirement savings. www.channelnewsasia.com",2023/2/16 10:42,cpf,TRUE,TRUE," the rise in the monthly salary ceiling essentially means that workers who earn more than s$6,000   and their employers   will have to contribute more to their $T$",-1

""this growth in utilisation and payout accounts for about two-thirds of the premium increases,"" he told the house. one-quarter of the premium increase comes from  refreshing  the claim limits of medishield life, while the remaining portion, just under 10 per cent,  supports the benefit enhancements , including those implemented since 2018. these include the extension of coverage to include inpatient hospices and serious pregnancy complications.  premiums have been kept unchanged for the first five years of medishield life, in line with our earlier public commitment. they need to be adjusted to ensure that the medishield life fund remains solvent and sustainable so that it can meet its obligations to all policyholders,  said dr koh. responding to a question from psp non-constituency mp leong mun wai on whether it is unusual by international standards for a health insurance scheme to increase its premiums by 35 per cent in a single adjustment, dr koh said it would not be appropriate to compare with other schemes as premiums are priced based on multiple factors  which inevitably vary from country to country . ""it would also not be meaningful to compute how much premiums a singaporean will need to pay over his lifetime simply by assuming a fixed compounding factor each year,"" said dr koh.  future premiums would depend on how the underlying drivers   evolve, and this depends on many factors including what we can achieve together to manage healthcare costs. the amount of premium subsidies an individual will receive will also vary over his lifetime, depending on his financial circumstances.  keeping premiums affordable financial support schemes are available to ensure that all singaporeans can continue to pay their premiums, said dr koh. for instance, lower- and middle-income households, as well as seniors from the merdeka generation and pioneer generation will receive premium subsidies and support.  taken together, about 35 per cent of the total premiums collected were paid for by the government through various subsidies and support schemes in 2019. for the elderly aged 65 and above, the contribution from the government is even higher, at about 50 per cent of their premiums,  he said. singaporeans can use medisave to pay for their premiums in full, and they can also use their medisave to pay for their family members  premiums as well. those who still require more help can apply for additional premium support, including those who are mid-way through medical treatment or who have recently lost their jobs and part of their income. the additional premium support will cover all outstanding and future premiums, said dr koh. in addition, singaporeans will receive a covid-19 subsidy for the next two years, which will  pay for the bulk of the premium increase in the first year , said dr koh. he noted that the government had considered deferring the medishield life review and the premium increases due to the current  difficult economic situation  with covid-19.  however, i must emphasise that it was important that medishield life remains solvent and sustainable so that it can meet its obligations in time to come when policyholders make claims. its coverage also has to be updated and enhanced to remain relevant to the healthcare needs of singaporeans,  he said. part of premiums set aside for future touching on the medishield life fund, dr koh said a portion of premiums paid by working adults is set aside to provide for future premium rebates, which will help to moderate premium increases as people age. ""this constitutes the bulk of future commitments set aside in the reserves. as the majority of policyholders are relatively young today, the amount set aside has been increasing,"" he said. dr koh added that other such commitments include diseases currently under treatment that will require long-term care, such as renal failure and cancer. providing figures in parliament, dr koh said a total of s$7.5 billion in premiums were collected between 2016 and 2019. this comprised s$4.4 billion collected from policyholders, and s$3.1 billion from the government in terms of subsidies and other forms of premium support. in this same period, s$3.5 billion in claims were paid out, while s$3 billion was set aside for future premium rebates. the incurred loss ratio of the fund was an average of 104 per cent over the period from 2016 to 2019. ""this means that the total premiums collected were slightly less than the total monies required to ensure that the fund is able to meet current claims and future commitments,"" said dr koh. he stressed that the fund has to be  self-sustaining  and based on  sound actuarial principles . ""premiums collected have to cover potential current and future payouts, including amounts set aside to support future commitments as well as provide a buffer against unforeseen contingencies such as unexpected spikes in hospitalizations due to disease outbreaks,"" he added. computing premium increases several mps raised questions relating to how premium increases are computed. in response to pap mp foo mee har s question on whether the ministry of health would  itemise  factors contributing to the premium increase, dr koh said that it is difficult to predict the technology driving clinical practice. in the past, a head injury would only warrant an x-ray of the skull, which costs about s$15 to s$20. but now, barely 20 years later, ct scans are required for head injuries, which can cost  hundreds of dollars , he said.  so as opposed to a transport fair formula where the parameters and variables are a little bit more fixed and more predictable, healthcare inflation takes into account many unforeseen kind of variables that will come along the way,  he said. while it will be hard to have a single formula with  that level of clarity , actuaries that use current data to project will make adjustments over time, and this is why the government has to review premiums on a regular basis, he added. wp mp gerald giam reiterated his question on whether the government would make the full medishield life actuarial report available, for the sake of transparency. dr koh said medishield life premiums are proposed and calculated by external actuaries who are independent from the government. the size of the funds, the amount collected and the amount paid out are also externally audited and the report will later be submitted to parliament on an annual basis, he added. however, dr koh acknowledged that the government may have to have a  better system  of looking at how the assumptions and calculations need to evolve.  over time, we could perhaps engage different consultants to take a look, to challenge the assumptions, to do another calculation at an appropriate time, to make sure that we are still on track,  he said. he added that ministry would speak to consultants on publishing some of the data  in an academic way , but emphasised that it will  not be something that most laypeople will understand .",2020/11/2 20:27,health insurance,TRUE,TRUE," responding to a question from psp non-constituency mp leong mun wai on whether it is unusual by international standards for a $T$ scheme to increase its premiums by 35 per cent in a single adjustment, dr koh said it would not be appropriate to compare with other schemes as premiums are priced based on multiple factors  which inevitably vary from country to country ",0

retirement, says david kuo of the smart investor. commentary: singapore residents must save for retirement today to continue enjoying low income taxes for direct taxes to remain low, singapore workers need to do more with their money to prepare for their future retirement, says david kuo of the smart investor. www.channelnewsasia.com singapore: the message from the budget 2023 speech could not have been clearer. it cannot be business as usual for singapore. over the last couple of decades, the country has benefited from global trade and finance flows. but with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. as the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. by 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. budget 2023 offers targeted support to singapore s growing pool of seniors . the eldercare fund will be topped up by s$500 million, and another s$1.5 billion will be added to the medifund. but just think about that for a moment. singapore expects a budget deficit of s$2 billion in the financial year (fy) of 2022, and a deficit of s$400 million in fy2023. those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. that is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. if we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won t need government subsidies. ensuring our retirement adequacy  as singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that singapore workers can do for themselves now. while the government has kept the rate of contributions to the central provident fund (cpf) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from s$6,000 to s$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . but this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. if so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. this number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. a 2019 lee kuan yew school of public policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in singapore is about s$1,400 a month. but considering that the median income per household member in singapore is about s$3,200 a month, which adds up to s$38,400 per year, let s work off a round figure of s$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. you can scale this up or down accordingly, but don t forget to factor in inflation. at an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our s$50,000 target would be equivalent to s$100,000 in around 24 years  time. and in 48 years  time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. that, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. that is the income we would need to generate from our savings. because we don t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the cpf special account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of s$100,000 a year in 24 years  time is s$2.5 million. we should ask ourselves if our accumulated cpf contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. if it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. that generally means investing in shares. there is a limit as to how much our cpf money can be invested in the stock market. so, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of cpf. the best time to do that is while we are young. indirect taxes prevail over direct taxes  budget 2023 also highlighted the government s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. so too will taxes on luxury cars . we can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. in the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. in the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. however, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. the upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the government to redistribute wealth. after all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. it is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. setting aside money for the next crisis  there was another important message in the budget. while the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. though singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year s budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. what s more, singapore must continue to consciously build up its reserves to prepare for the next crisis. we need to do the same too. the government has provided singaporeans with the means to cope with inflationary pressures through voucher schemes . this should help ease some of the pain when we do our daily shopping. more importantly, it buys us time to set aside some money for a rainy day because wages are rising but income tax rates aren t. it is a window of opportunity that other developed economies have been unable to provide. but we need to fix our roofs when the sun is shining. it will be too late when thunderstorms hit. in summary, budget 2023 puts households firmly in the driving seat. the government is treating people as mature adults in a maturing economy. the country s finances are strong and should be even stronger over time. we too can make our household finances stronger over time by being prudent with our spending and preparing for future uncertainties. if we want our taxes to remain low, we need to do our part to ensure that it stays that way. david kuo is co-founder of the smart investor.",2023/2/23 9:09,low income,TRUE,FALSE," commentary: singapore residents must save for

which obviously will erode national cohesion and trust in government in the long run. instead of disbursing medishield-life subsidies liberally (indiscriminately) like one distracts children with cheap candies, a more targeted carrot-stick based upon health consciousness can keep overall cohort medicals claims costs low: e.g. maintaining a low % body fat (below 15% for males and below 25% for females), performing well in fitness tests (modeled after universally used military fitness test like ippt, with swimming/ cycling alternatives), non-smoking status are all very good (anti-diabetes) options to consider for substantive 'earned' waivers from the costs of premiums for compulsory medishield-life which can be implemented on a national level, as well as the total banning of the use of riders, would make the basic medishield-life scheme a more trusted medical insurance scheme whereby the concept of healthcare insurance returns to the original philosophy of insuring calamities which are unpreventable by doing everything within control to avoid the avoidable (e.g. type 2 diabetes due to sedentary lifestyle, high% body fat causing diabetes etc) . rather than a sneaky way for the rich to siphon $$$ from the poor to fund their own irresponsible and lavish lifestyles in the ultimate tragedy of the commons and let singapore go bankrupt due to the lawless, free for all, self-serving buffet syndrom mentality, the result of an extremely poorly planned and executed national healthcare insurance policy. ========================= from: https://www.facebook.com/goh.gilbert/posts/10157361126798975?pnref=story visited a 50-year-old man who skips his medical appointment twice because he could not gather enough transport money to visit the doctor. he is suspected to have initial stage of cancer of the pancreas and liver. he lost about 30 kg from his previous weight and looks jaundiced. he also owes a few months of utilities, rental and town council charges but feels most worried about the rental debts as hdb has dropped by already to check on him. he is afraid of losing the home though i assured him that so far hdb has not go hard on rental defaultors unlike purchased flat owners. surprisingly, sso has rejected his welfare application citing that he still has a son who is now working as an intern earning $1200/month. his malaysian wife is currently back in malaysia undergoing dialysis for her diabetic condition. of course, the sso wants him to get back to work but his ill health and frail body are not helping him much. he is currently awaiting approval from comcare side after visiting his mp. i left jefri after leaving him with a small amount of cash for his meals and assured him that we will assist in one way or another. a regular donor has pledged $500 to offset the $600-over rental default and someone has already paid $100 into the sp bill. at least he will have a roof over his head as he nurses his health slowly back to normal. apologise that the video is abit soft and last five minutes. poor people's campaign: a ground-up community initiative to improve the living condition of the poor among us. ======================= everyone must compulsorily conform to the concept of 'pre-funding', however, ultimately, it is the poor who paradoxically subsidise the rich since the rich (leveraging upon insurance 'riders') get to claim 60% more (even after proration is considered): reply from moh 27 nov 2013, straits times role of pre-funding we thank mr david boey (""problems with pre-funding""; nov 19), ms maria loh mun foong (""merits of pre-funding""; last thursday) and mr tan kin lian (""pre-funding not feasible for medishield life""; forum online, monday) for sharing their views on the concept of pre-funding for medishield. the letters from mr boey and ms loh may have created the wrong impression that the proposed pre-funding concept will require the younger generation to cross-subsidise the current elderly. for medishield, the pre-funded amount contributed by each cohort is set aside for the future use of their own respective cohorts , and not used to cross-subsidise the current elderly. to address concerns over affordability of premiums among the current cohort of elderly singaporeans, the government has indicated its plans to provide help for the older generation of singaporeans. as noted by mr tan, health-care costs tend to be higher for the elderly. this, plus the effects of medical advancements and changing expectations, will put further upward pressure on future premiums as we age. for this reason, it will be even more important to set aside some premiums in advance, or pre-funding, to address concerns of premium affordability during old age. with pre-funding, members pay higher premiums during their working ages and, in return, can receive rebates to offset their own future premiums when they grow old. with the ongoing review and enhancement of medishield to medishield life, one of the key issues the medishield life review committee hopes to engage the public on is increasing the role of pre-funding. the committee welcomes all singaporeans to provide their feedback or sign up for upcoming discussion sessions through www.medishieldlife.sg philip sim deputy director corporate communications ministry of health https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/pressroom/media_forums/2013/role-of-pre-funding-.html",2018/3/12 4:29,medishield life,TRUE,FALSE," with the ongoing review and enhancement of medishield to $T$, one of the key issues the medishield life review committee hopes to engage the public on is increasing the role of pre-funding",0

""understanding how fabrication, assembly and installation work will make a designer become more adept and all-rounded at his or her job, and consequently improve productivity for the company,"" he added. mr phua said the pcp will help build a strong singapore core to ensure the continuity of businesses and renovation projects, particularly with the ongoing pandemic. during the nine-month programme, trainees will learn about construction technology, production processes, technical drawings, furniture installation, and advance construction methods in furniture making, among other things. they will also be equipped with soft skills in negotiation, project risk management, teamwork and handling client relationships. this will be done through classroom and workshop-based learning, as well as on-the-job training. wsg chief executive tan choon shian said technology has accelerated the transformation of the traditionally labour-intensive sector. ""this pcp allows the next generation of installers to take on higher value roles in using advanced technology, and skillsets in client and project management,"" he added. at the launch event, 10 local firms signed a memorandum of understanding with the sfic institute to take on new hires under the programme. mr michael soh, managing director of interior fittings manufacturer redwood interior, one of the participating firms, said that given singapore's manpower constraints, the programme will upskill workers and equip them with the know-how to operate advanced machinery, thereby increasing their productivity. among those keen on joining the pcp is mr joey tay, a former furniture designer turned workshop manager. he said the programme would help participants acquire in-demand skills ""required to enter this industry and carve out a fulfilling career"". new conversion programme to nurture local specialists for interior fitting services the professional conversion programme for interior fit-out specialists will take in the first cohort by july.. read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com",2021/6/2 12:09,professional conversion programme,TRUE,FALSE, new conversion programme to nurture local specialists for interior fitting services the $T$ for interior fit-out specialists will take in the first cohort by july,0

 the citizens  panel concept is one of the ways public agencies are engaging singaporeans to deliberate on difficult and sensitive topics. early last year, ips had conducted a panel on youth mental well-being. panel participants on saturday included full- and part-time employees, gig workers and career counsellors. most of the employees are aged 21 to 50 years old. one of them, career counsellor jeremiah wong, 38, said most singaporeans would think of a person s career as finding a job or writing resumes. but it s more than that, he said. said mr wong:  a career is a lifetime of work, play, occupation, training, education and job search, including leisure.  ntuc secretary general ng chee meng also spoke at the opening day of the citizens  panel. singapore university of social sciences  associate professor of economics, walter theseira, at the panel s expert speakers  discussion, said unemployment support, such as unemployment insurance, would thus be useful for the protection of workers who lose their jobs. however, he added, the worry is that good protection for the unemployed can increase unemployment rates as some people may not be motivated to find work quickly while employers can abuse the system. he said:  for the employer, when you have a well-functioning unemployment insurance system, it actually becomes more socially acceptable and cheaper to retrench workers because they are not responsible for the workers after termination.  these costs have to be weighed against the benefits of social protection as well as helping workers find more productive job matches. the citizens  panel will have to debate what they feel is the right set of trade-offs.

""importantly, any decision in this regard would have to consider the risks of wealthy individuals redirecting their assets abroad,"" he noted. mr david sandison, head of tax at grant thornton singapore, said that real estate-based taxes are the ""lowest hanging fruit"", as they are easy to collect and legislate. grant thornton has proposed several real estate taxes, including raising the property tax further for unoccupied residential property owned by non-residents and a capital gains tax on transactions in residential property with an exclusion for a principal private residence. ms shantini ramachandra, southeast asia tax leader for deloitte private, said that wealth taxes could take the form of a recalibration of property tax rates or buyer's stamp duty rates for higher-value residential properties. like mr sandison, she also said another option could be a capital gains tax on the sale of luxury residential properties. ""the introduction of a new wealth tax that is solely targeted at the private assets of the wealthy, or the introduction of inheritance or gift taxes, would be counter-intuitive to the efforts that the singapore government has put in place to develop singapore into a premier hub for wealth management and to attract foreign investors to invest, work and live in singapore,"" she said.",2022/2/12 11:58,wealth tax,TRUE,FALSE," a property-related tax would be easiest to implement and enforce, experts said, noting that any form of $T$, if implemented, should not result in excessive compliance costs for taxpayers",0
