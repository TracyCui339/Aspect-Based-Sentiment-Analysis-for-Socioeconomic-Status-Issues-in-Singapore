Among resident employed households, monthly household income from work grew by 6.1 per cent in nominal terms, or before adjusting for inflation, from $9,520 in 2021 to $10,099 in 2022. Such households are where the household reference person - previously referred to as the head of household - is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and have at least one employed person. After adjusting for inflation, median monthly household income from work rose 0.2 per cent in real terms, or after adjusting for inflation, in 2022. Household income from work includes employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions. From 2017 to 2022, median monthly household income from work of resident employed households increased 2.9 per cent cumulatively, or 0.6 per cent per annum in real terms. Taking into account household size, median monthly household income from work per household member rose from $3,027 in 2021 to $3,287 in 2022, an increase of 8.6 per cent in nominal terms or 2.6 per cent in real terms. From 2017 to 2022, median monthly household income per household member grew by 11.9 per cent cumulatively or 2.3 per cent per annum in real terms. All but top earners see real incomes rise\u200b Households across most income deciles saw increases in real average household income from work per household member. In 2022, the average household income from work per household member of resident employed households in all income groups rose in nominal terms, with the increases ranging from 5.3 to 15.6 per cent. After adjusting for inflation, households in the first nine deciles saw real income growth of 1.1 to 10.1 per cent, while those in the top decile saw a real income decline of 1.3 per cent. Between 2017 and 2022, the average household income from work per household member of resident employed households in the first nine deciles rose 1.5 to 3.0 per cent per annum in real terms, while that in the top decile recorded a decline of 0.4 per cent per annum in real terms. The decline experienced by the top decile was because of a larger increase in household size from 2.26 in 2021 to 2.34 in 2022, compared to households in the other deciles. This, coupled with higher inflation experienced in 2022, contributed to the decline in their real household income in 2022. More government transfers\u200b Resident households, including households with no employed person, received $5,765 per household member on average from Government schemes in 2022. This was higher than the $5,257 received in 2021, due to the one-off and transitionary measures in 2022, as well as enhanced schemes, to cushion the impact of the GST rate increase and higher inflation on cost of living, said SingStat. Resident households staying in HDB 1- & 2-room flats continued to receive the most government transfers. In 2022, they received $12,189 per household member on average from government schemes, close to double the transfers received by resident households staying in HDB 3-room flats. The Gini coefficient based on household income from work per household member - before Government transfers and taxes - fell to 0.437 in 2022, from 0.444 in 2021. Income inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient. A Gini coefficient equal to zero occurs when there is total income equality, and it hits one when there is total inequality. After adjusting for Government transfers and taxes, the Gini coefficient in 2022 fell from 0.437 to 0.378. \u201cThis reflected the redistributive effect of Government transfers and taxes,\u201d said SingStat. Nonetheless, this is still slightly higher than the Gini coefficient of 0.375 in 2020, which was the lowest on record. The report on \u201cKey Household Income Trends, 2022\u201d is available on SingStat\u2019s website. Household incomes in S\u2019pore rise in 2022 but inflation chips away at growth After adjusting for inflation, households in the first nine deciles saw real income growth of 1.1 to 10.1 per cent.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE \u2013 After a close to three-year delay due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre opened on Saturday, marking it the first such facility in Sembawang in about 30 years. The site was part of Chong Pang Village, which used to house a wet market and hawker centre and was demolished in the 1980s. Speaking at the hawker centre on Saturday, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, who is also an MP for Sembawang GRC, said: \u201cThere are many interesting features in this hawker centre. Cost of living is always an issue, and with the hawker centre now, we can generally lower the food prices for residents.\u201d The 800-seat facility has 44 stalls, with only one vacant. Four sell halal food, another four Indian fare, and the rest a mix of Asian items. About 10 per cent of the stalls are run by Sembawang residents. On Saturday morning, most of the tables were taken up and long queues formed at some stalls. Residents said the hawker centre is a long-awaited addition to the community. For Mr Joshua Batula, a 27-year-old software engineer, it is a five-minute walk from his home and gives him more food choices. \u201cIt has been quite a wait, and residents here were eagerly expecting this to open. Before this, if I wanted hawker food, there was only one similar foodcourt nearby. \u201cThe layout here is also quite special because it is close to the park connector and other sports facilities, which is good for me because I play sports.\u201d Ms Kalin Tan, 52, a Sembawang resident of more than 30 years, said: \u201cI came today because I heard it was the opening, and I wanted to look around. The food is not bad although (the price) is a bit on the higher side.\u201d Ms Tan, who is self-employed, previously had to go to Chong Pang Market and Food Centre in Yishun to get hawker food. The new hawker centre is part of the Bukit Canberra integrated sports and community hub, which will have other facilities such as a multipurpose hall, swimming complex and polyclinic. The pools and a gym are expected to be ready in the first half of 2023 while the multipurpose hall is already open.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - The High Court has allowed an 84-year-old woman to claim from insurers about $39,000 in government subsidies and grants that was used to foot her medical bills after she was hurt in a traffic accident. But Madam Eng Beng would also have to make good on her word to return this amount to the public coffers. On Tuesday, Justice Tan Siong Thye awarded Madam Eng $39,515.08 in special damages, comprising various government subsidies and grants that were deducted from her medical bills. The judge directed Madam Eng to return this amount, less the legal costs she incurred in pursuing her claim, to the Ministry of Health (MOH). The ministry is free to let her keep the money or use it for other public purposes. Madam Eng had earlier told the court that if her claim was allowed, she was willing to accept the court\u2019s order that the funds be returned. Justice Tan said her \u201cgracious overture\u201d would completely demolish the insurer\u2019s argument that Madam Eng would have enjoyed double recovery if it paid the sum to her. On Jan 9, 2020, Madam Eng, then 81, was crossing the road when she was knocked down by a car driven by Mr Lo Kok Jong. She was hospitalised at Tan Tock Seng Hospital for serious injuries, including a fractured ankle, and was later moved to a community hospital. In June 2020, Madam Eng, represented by Ms V.M. Vidthiya, filed a negligence suit against Mr Lo. On July 2, 2022, a deputy registrar awarded Madam Eng damages of $36,348.64, comprising general damages of $18,600 for pain and suffering as well as special damages for medical expenses, transport expenses and medical apparatus. The deputy registrar, however, refused to award her an additional sum of $39,515.08, which she had claimed as special damages for medical expenses. This sum comprised generic government and Pioneer Generation subsidies, and government grants for community hospital services and medical drugs. These sums were deducted from her bills and as a result, she paid less than $500 out of pocket. After her appeal to a district judge was dismissed, she took her case to the High Court. In his written judgment, Justice Tan noted that generally, if an injured plaintiff has received collateral benefits from parties other than the defendant, this should be taken into account when considering the amount recoverable from the defendant. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule against double recovery. First, where the injured plaintiff recovers a payout under an insurance policy for which the person has paid the premiums, the insurance monies are not deductible from damages payable. Second, where the injured plaintiff receives funds from the benevolence of others prompted by sympathy, the donated funds are not deductible from damages payable. Madam Eng argued that the subsidies and grants could fall within the benevolence exception. Mr Lo\u2019s insurers argued that the subsidies and grants do not contain the requisite charitable intent, as they were not \u201cprompted by sympathy\u201d but attached systematically to her by virtue of citizenship, age and income level. Justice Tan said the court cannot ignore the reality that the subsidies and grants are part of schemes that utilise taxpayers\u2019 monies to support the healthcare needs of the population. He noted that the insurer\u2019s lawyers admitted that it would have been willing to compensate Madam Eng for private hospital medical bills if she had sought treatment at a private hospital. He said it was ultimately a binary situation \u2013 should Madam Eng be able to claim the amount from Mr Lo\u2019s insurers, or should the insurers benefit by being able to pay her a lower sum after the deduction of subsidies and grants? \u201cThe commonsensical answer must be that the Government extended the subsidies and grants amounting to $39,515.08 specifically to the appellant for her enjoyment, and not to relieve the respondent of his liability,\u201d said the judge. He concluded that subsidies and grants were specifically conferred upon Madam Eng as she had met the stringent criteria, and that they were akin to collateral benefits that fall within the benevolence exception.",2023-03-22T11:59:32,medical expenses

Earlier this week at a press briefing, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said though COVID-19 patterns are hard to predict, the XBB.1.16 Omicron subvariant is the one to watch and is fueling a steady rise in cases in India. In its weekly update on the pandemic yesterday, the WHO said it added XBB.1.16 as the sixth variant under monitoring on Mar 22. It also said though global cases and deaths continue to decline, some countries\u2014including India\u2014are reporting recent spikes in cases. XBB.1.16 edged out other variants in India\u200b At a Mar 29 press briefing , Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, the WHO's technical lead for COVID-19, said XBB.1.16 has a similar profile to XBB.1.5 but has an additional changes in the spike protein. She said XBB.1.16 has replaced other circulating subvariants in India. So far, there are about 800 sequences from 22 countries, mostly from India. Van Kerkhove said in lab studies, XBB.1.16 has shown signs of increased infectivity as well as potentially increased pathogenicity. ""So this is one to watch. It's been in circulation for a few months,"" she said. ""We haven't seen a change in severity in individuals or in populations, but that's why we have these systems in place."" India this week reported its highest levels COVID cases in 6 months, prompting stepped up testing and an advisory to increase mask use in New Delhi. Rising cases in South Asia and Middle East\u200b In its weekly pandemic snapshot yesterday, the WHO said overall cases and deaths continue to decline, but said several countries are reporting significant increases in cases. Case trends in four WHO regions declined or held steady, but levels are on the rise in the Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia region, an area that includes India. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran, Kuwait, and Libya reported the biggest proportional increases over the last 28 days, with the highest numbers reported from Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Iran's health minister yesterday said that the latest COVID-19 wave has led to an increase in hospitalizations and that both XBB and BQ.1 subvariants are circulating, Anadolu Agency reported today. Thirteen cities are in the red risk category, and the spike in activity is occurring alongside the Iranian New Year Holiday. In the WHO's South East Asia region, India has both the highest proportional rise in cases and the most cases over the past 4 weeks. Also, Indonesia reported a modest rise in cases. US markers decline, XBB.1.5 reaches saturation\u200b In a biweekly data summary today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said US COVID markers continue to decline. The 7-day average for new daily COVID cases is about 20,000, down 9.2% compared to the previous 7-day average. About 228 people die from COVID each day, down 29.4% compared to the previous 7-day average for deaths. In its latest variant proportion estimates, the CDC said XBB.1.5 has reached saturation, making up 87.9% of samples, and that three other Omicron subvariants show positive growth.

Called Single Room Shared Facilities, this new housing type aims to give tenants greater privacy while providing a community-type living environment, said the Housing Board on Monday. HDB will pilot the initiative at the former Anderson Junior College hostel in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8, which comprises two 11-storey blocks. The site will be able to house 480 tenants in single rooms, fully partitioned out of 240 units. Each room, about 9 sq m, will come fitted with basic furnishings such a single-size bed frame, wardrobe, table, chair, wall shelves and a mini refrigerator. Tenants will have to buy their own mattress for hygiene reasons, said HDB. The 24 tenants on each level will share common facilities such as toilets, and kitchens equipped with five cooking stoves, sinks and cabinets. They will also share laundry and activity rooms, as well as dining areas repurposed from former study rooms. This set-up is unlike the Joint Singles Scheme Operator-Run model implemented in end-2021, which pairs singles to share a one- or two-room HDB flat which are semi-partitioned. Speaking to reporters after a tour of a sample unit, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the former hostel site was picked to reduce the preparation time to start the pilot as HDB could \u201cmake do with the existing infrastructure and make adjustments to it\u201d. \u201cIf we do make this a permanent feature of our rental flat offerings, there will be of course changes to the configurations and the ratio (of tenants to facilities). This is using existing infrastructure and making do with what we have to test out this model,\u201d he added. Mr Lee said the pilot will run for one to two years for HDB to collect data on whether the model will work, and if it should be included among the Government\u2019s public rental schemes. The former hostel site is currently still being fitted out, and singles will be able to apply individually in end-2023 when it is ready. The prevailing public rental eligibility criteria for singles will apply. An operator will be appointed to manage the site, including managing tenancy matters and providing social support, as well as furnishing and maintaining the premises, said HDB.

Let me start with my own personal opinion about how the Singapore education system can be improved: To change to skills based, from the current talking based, * Scrap away humanities subjects: social studies, geography, history, literature. Keep only english to recognize that the situational writing and english language paper 2 are enough to train and test and prepare students for the world, in terms of talking. * Add in religion studies, to take the place of humanities, and also to replace the Civics and Moral Education. This will ensure that the students are equipped with moral values, upon completing the 10 years of compulsory education at 16 years old. Religious studies should be compulsory, and be one of the O level examination subjects. * Secondary time, the secondary school should use AI to help every student identify what are their strengths, based on their academic performance in secondary one and secondary two. It can be a simple listing down of all the final results of the subjects that they have tested in secondary one and secondary two, and ranking them from the best to the worst. Then, offer a suitable subject combination. Currently, the freedom to choose, a bit too headless chicken already. Children only 14 years old, they know how to make wise decision meh? Should actually use AI, as mentioned above, to help them make the right decision. Okay, the secondary 2 streaming quite important, as it will influence the later part: tertiary and university. * Tertiary: this is when a lot of people will waste their time. However, it can be mitigated, if the right decision is made at secondary 2 streaming. * Tertiary and University: learn from Hong Kong, merge the local polytechnics and universities into Polytechnic Universities. This recommendation, to have Polytechnic Universities, will help to lower the age of Singaporeans entering the society to work full-time in their professional career. Currently, Singaporean Males only enter the society to work full-time at the age of 25 to 27. Girls probably around 23 years old. Entering earlier can improve our Singaporeans' competitiveness. If merge Poly and Uni together, * It will be 100% in that profession; no language module or whatever physical education module. * Can potentially reduce the learning to just 3 to 4 years, thereby increasing the Returns on Investment, and reducing the time and other resources required. * After 1 year into 100% learning that profession, those students who cannot make it one, should be forced to change profession; boys should be forced to enlist national service first, when they are more mature in their learning then return to school to learn another profession that is more suitable for them. That said, ITE and JC should be scrapped. Everyone all go through the Polytechnic University route. Good idea hor? Not only would it make it a level playing field for every Singaporean, It will save a considerable amount of time and other resources, and Singaporeans would be able to enter the society to work full-time at a younger age and at a more competitive level, Thereby having more ability to excel in the Singapore economy, and the global economy. The above are my opinions. Can't believe from a small seed can evolve into one big tree that encompasses the Singapore education system from secondary to the time when Singaporeans actually enter the society to work full-time in their professional career. In the following weeks, due to the Mercury and Jupiter Conjunction, this is when there will be people talking about their aspirations for the future, at the same time there will also be people who will be expressing their pessimism about matters. Therefore, now may be a good time to really talk about how we can really improve the Singapore education system, rather than just have a casual conversation about it every Sunday. Let's have a fruitful discussion about how we can improve the Singapore education system.",2023-02-26T15:38:06,elite education

They were speaking to The Straits Times on 2022 household income figures released by the Singapore Department of Statistics (SingStat) on Thursday. Median monthly household income from work rose 0.2 per cent in real terms, or after adjusting for inflation, in 2022. This is lower than the 1.5 per cent increase registered in 2021. After adjusting for inflation, households in the first nine deciles saw real income growth. Only the top decile saw a drop in real income. Asked why this is so, analysts said the highest income group could be most affected by high inflation, as they spend more on big-ticket items such as cars, air tickets and private properties. Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the National University of Singapore Business School\u2019s Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said top income earners are usually professionals whose incomes are subject to variations due to the economic situation, which has not been favourable in recent years. \u201cIt is normally more difficult to sustain the high bases in income as one goes up the earnings ladder,\u201d he added. Experts said cost of living remains a concern, especially for middle-income households. The fall in income inequality, they added, showed that Government measures to uplift the lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Model and Workfare Income Supplement scheme have been effective. Income inequality is also moderated by government transfers. Government job and wage support schemes during the pandemic allowed lower income earners to maintain their pay or even keep their jobs, said Prof Loh. After adjusting for government transfers and taxes, the Gini coefficient in 2022 fell from 0.437 to 0.378. This compares favourably with some developing nations, which have a Gini coefficient of around 0.6, said NUS sociology professor Tan Ern Ser. But a look at wealth inequality may present a different picture, he added. Wealthier individuals may have income from sources other than employment, such as investments, property and inherited wealth, which are not accounted for in SingStat data. CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the increase in real household incomes showed that the post-Covid-19 re-opening of the economy has created more opportunities, with the labour market tightening significantly. To further narrow the income gap in the long run, higher wages and quality jobs would help the lowest earners. He said that while inflation remains high, it may have peaked in 2022. \u201cInflation becomes a concern only when it becomes entrenched, and expectations for inflation continue to rise and outstrip nominal wage growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do see this... where we have supply disruptions and various issues like the Ukraine war, but it looks like the worst of inflation may be behind us.\u201d OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said: \u201cInflation may not ease significantly this year, at least not in the first half of the year, especially for core inflation, so both nominal and real wage income growth may remain muted. \u201cFor households, especially middle income ones, they will likely still feel the pain from being squeezed by higher prices for most goods and services, as well as higher debt servicing burdens due to rising interest rates.\u201d She added that nominal wage growth may not keep pace with inflation in 2023, with headline and core inflation likely to come in at around 6 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. But, she observed, unemployment rates are very low and employment gains jumped in 2022. Higher-income earners hit by expensive items; worst of inflation may be over: Analysts Experts said cost of living remains a concern, especially for middle-income households.

Among resident employed households, monthly household income from work grew by 6.1 per cent in nominal terms, or before adjusting for inflation, from $9,520 in 2021 to $10,099 in 2022. Such households are where the household reference person - previously referred to as the head of household - is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and have at least one employed person. After adjusting for inflation, median monthly household income from work rose 0.2 per cent in real terms, or after adjusting for inflation, in 2022. Household income from work includes employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions. From 2017 to 2022, median monthly household income from work of resident employed households increased 2.9 per cent cumulatively, or 0.6 per cent per annum in real terms. Taking into account household size, median monthly household income from work per household member rose from $3,027 in 2021 to $3,287 in 2022, an increase of 8.6 per cent in nominal terms or 2.6 per cent in real terms. From 2017 to 2022, median monthly household income per household member grew by 11.9 per cent cumulatively or 2.3 per cent per annum in real terms. All but top earners see real incomes rise\u200b Households across most income deciles saw increases in real average household income from work per household member. In 2022, the average household income from work per household member of resident employed households in all income groups rose in nominal terms, with the increases ranging from 5.3 to 15.6 per cent. After adjusting for inflation, households in the first nine deciles saw real income growth of 1.1 to 10.1 per cent, while those in the top decile saw a real income decline of 1.3 per cent. Between 2017 and 2022, the average household income from work per household member of resident employed households in the first nine deciles rose 1.5 to 3.0 per cent per annum in real terms, while that in the top decile recorded a decline of 0.4 per cent per annum in real terms. The decline experienced by the top decile was because of a larger increase in household size from 2.26 in 2021 to 2.34 in 2022, compared to households in the other deciles. This, coupled with higher inflation experienced in 2022, contributed to the decline in their real household income in 2022. More government transfers\u200b Resident households, including households with no employed person, received $5,765 per household member on average from Government schemes in 2022. This was higher than the $5,257 received in 2021, due to the one-off and transitionary measures in 2022, as well as enhanced schemes, to cushion the impact of the GST rate increase and higher inflation on cost of living, said SingStat. Resident households staying in HDB 1- & 2-room flats continued to receive the most government transfers. In 2022, they received $12,189 per household member on average from government schemes, close to double the transfers received by resident households staying in HDB 3-room flats. The Gini coefficient based on household income from work per household member - before Government transfers and taxes - fell to 0.437 in 2022, from 0.444 in 2021. Income inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient. A Gini coefficient equal to zero occurs when there is total income equality, and it hits one when there is total inequality. After adjusting for Government transfers and taxes, the Gini coefficient in 2022 fell from 0.437 to 0.378. \u201cThis reflected the redistributive effect of Government transfers and taxes,\u201d said SingStat. Nonetheless, this is still slightly higher than the Gini coefficient of 0.375 in 2020, which was the lowest on record. The report on \u201cKey Household Income Trends, 2022\u201d is available on SingStat\u2019s website.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - Employment resilience is not just about landing a job quickly after being displaced, but also about finding better jobs and roles that are even more fulfilling than the previous one. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said this at the start of a citizens\u2019 panel on employment resilience on Saturday organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and funded by The Ngee Ann Kongsi. The panel will see about 66 participants comprising employees, employers, employment intermediaries and the unemployed meet over four sessions to offer recommendations on how to strengthen employment resilience. The key topics on the agenda include how to encourage workers to take a more active role in managing their careers throughout their working lives. And how to design an unemployment support scheme that strikes a balance between ensuring adequate income support and encouraging active job search. The proposals will be presented to the government during the final session on March 25. Dr Tan said he hopes that from the discussions, they could co-create policies together. Drawing an analogy between health and employment resilience, he said one should not wait until he is at risk of unemployment before he starts thinking about career planning. Just as one should prioritise preventive health and go for health check-ups. He cited how things could go south quickly, which was what happened when Covid-19 hit Singapore in 2020, with 42,000 unemployed residents from the onset of the pandemic. On the panel\u2019s importance, Dr Tan added: \u201cTherefore, it is important for us to come together, to glean ideas from all of you, to sharpen our measures too. \u201cSo that we can be a lot more precise, incisive, more surgical in some of the options that you have, for us to upskill, upgrade, consolidate and refresh our social compact.\u201d Dr Carol Soon, senior research fellow and head of the Society and Culture department at IPS, said the panel is happening amid new disruptions. With changes brought on by the pandemic, technology and digitalisation and the rise of gig work. She said: \u201cUnexpected crises such as the pandemic and the Ukraine war create unemployment shocks. Take technology, while it has a positive impact, it can lead to workers being displaced. \u201cAlso, with more people working from home, the flip side is that the same job can be performed by anyone from any part of the world.\u201d Dr Tan said externally, workers are at risk of displacement due to technology, supply chain changes and other disruptions. Domestically, Singaporeans are living longer and receiving better education. They have longer career runways, and there will be opportunities for multiple career options. But he added careers require hard work and consistent efforts to upkeep. He said: \u201cJust like physical health, we do fall sick from time to time. So, when we do face setbacks in our careers, how do we recover... how do we bounce back better?\u201d The citizens\u2019 panel concept is one of the ways public agencies are engaging Singaporeans to deliberate on difficult and sensitive topics. Early last year, IPS had conducted a panel on youth mental well-being. Panel participants on Saturday included full- and part-time employees, gig workers and career counsellors. Most of the employees are aged 21 to 50 years old. One of them, career counsellor Jeremiah Wong, 38, said most Singaporeans would think of a person\u2019s career as finding a job or writing resumes. But it\u2019s more than that, he said. Said Mr Wong: \u201cA career is a lifetime of work, play, occupation, training, education and job search, including leisure.\u201d NTUC Secretary General Ng Chee Meng also spoke at the opening day of the citizens\u2019 panel. Singapore University of Social Sciences\u2019 Associate Professor of economics, Walter Theseira, at the panel\u2019s expert speakers\u2019 discussion, said unemployment support, such as unemployment insurance, would thus be useful for the protection of workers who lose their jobs. However, he added, the worry is that good protection for the unemployed can increase unemployment rates as some people may not be motivated to find work quickly while employers can abuse the system. He said: \u201cFor the employer, when you have a well-functioning unemployment insurance system, it actually becomes more socially acceptable and cheaper to retrench workers because they are not responsible for the workers after termination. \u201cThese costs have to be weighed against the benefits of social protection as well as helping workers find more productive job matches. The citizens\u2019 panel will have to debate what they feel is the right set of trade-offs.\u201d",2023-02-11T21:06:40,unemployment insurance

While the phased increase by 2026 can help soothe the impact, some smaller firms will still feel an additional \u201cfinancial burden\u201d, they added. The ceiling sets out the maximum amount of ordinary wages that can be used to compute CPF contributions. An example of an \u201cordinary wage\u201d would be a monthly salary. This is currently set at S$6,000 and will go up in four stages to S$8,000 by 2026, as announced by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 14). The first increase to S$6,300 will kick in on Sep 1 this year, before the next hike to S$6,800 in 2024. It will be raised again to S$7,400 in 2025 before reaching S$8,000 in 2026. The CPF annual salary ceiling, which takes into account additional wages such as a performance bonus, remains at S$102,000. Currently, employees aged up to 55 years old contribute 20 per cent of their wages to their CPF, while employers contribute 17 per cent. The rise in the monthly salary ceiling essentially means that workers who earn more than S$6,000 \u2013 and their employers \u2013 will have to contribute more to their CPF. The Singapore Business Federation (SBF), which represents 27,000 companies, said the move will add to businesses' manpower costs. The pressures on this front are already piling up with the rise in foreign worker levies, local qualifying salaries and wage adjustments under the Progressive Wage Model, it said. \u201cSBF urges the Government to consider spacing out some of these wage and manpower-related policies to help businesses survive immediate cost challenges,\u201d said Mr Albert Tsui, executive director of the federation's advocacy and policy division. Beyond labour costs, businesses have also been paying more in other aspects of their operations ranging from logistics, raw materials to energy, said Professor Sumit Agarwal from the National University of Singapore (NUS). \u201cWill this change cause a burden on employers? Clearly it will because it\u2019s a tough time with rising costs and economic uncertainties,\u201d said the professor of finance, economics and real estate at the NUS Business School. Some businesses may have to pass on these costs to consumers, he added. Deloitte Singapore\u2019s tax partner Yap Hsien Yew described the announcement as possibly being \u201ca financial burden\u201d for businesses, especially small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) which may not have the same access to cash flow and healthy profits as larger corporations. Beyond financial metrics, the impact on SMEs will also differ depending on the industry. Those that employ more higher-income workers will feel the heat, said the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME). This group will likely involve SMEs in industries such as technology and professional services such as accounting and auditing. \u201cIn other sectors like retail, most of the workers employed by SMEs are between the salary range of S$2,500 to $$4,000, which means they will not be affected in the near term,\u201d said the association's vice-president Ang Yuit. PHASED INCREASE TO CUSHION IMPACT \u200b The phased increase in the CPF monthly salary ceiling will help cushion the impact on employers, both ASME and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) said. This will allow employers to ""gradually adjust and factor this increase"" into their business costs against the backdrop of slower economic growth, rising costs and a tight labour market, added SNEF, which has more than 3,400 members. The CPF annual salary ceiling has also been left unchanged for now, said Prof Agarwal, noting that this will also mitigate the impact on businesses. Mr Christopher Gee, a senior research fellow and head of the governance and economy department at the Institute of Policy Studies, estimates that the change in the monthly salary ceiling, when fully implemented by 2026, will result in an increase of S$2 billion to S$2.5 billion in labour costs annually . This increase would need to be offset by productivity gains to ensure it is sustainable for businesses and their workers in the long run, he wrote in a commentary. Deloitte's Mr Yap said employers should view the announcement as helping to build a more financially secure workforce, which ultimately benefits them in the long run. \u201cWhile the increase may be a financial burden in the short term, it is an investment that businesses should consider in order to reap the long-term benefits of having a financially secure and experienced workforce,\u201d he told CNA. It was also announced in Budget 2023 that the Government will continue with the next increase in CPF contribution rates for older workers , following the first two steps of increases in 2022 and 2023. From next year, the total CPF contribution rates for workers aged 56 to 60 and 61 to 65 will go up by 1.5 percentage points to 31 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively. The contribution rate for workers aged 66 to 70 will rise by 1 percentage point to 16.5 per cent. To mitigate the rise in business costs, employers will get a one-year offset that is equivalent to half of the 2024 increase in employer contribution rates for every Singaporean and permanent resident they employ aged 56 to 70. 'A financial burden': Higher CPF salary ceiling will add to businesses' woes, say associations and experts The increase in the CPF salary ceiling means that those who earn more than S$6,000 \u2013 and their employers \u2013 will soon have to contribute more towards their retirement savings. www.channelnewsasia.com",2023-02-16T10:42:01,central provident fund

Her treatment cost was fully covered by national insurance scheme MediShield Life and national medical savings scheme MediSave, until December 2022, when she had to top up $268.50 in cash. This came as a shock. She has yet to receive her January bill. But she is afraid she might have to continue to pay cash every month due to the change in the way cancer treatments for subsidised patients have been covered since Sept 1, 2022. The change essentially lowered her claim limits for both MediShield Life and MediSave. The September policy change was meant to slow down spiralling cancer costs as well as to help patients better afford cancer care, including more expensive drugs. Since then, both MediShield Life and MediSave were allowed to cover only approved cancer drug treatments. Treatments not on the Cancer Drug List cannot be covered. The same will apply to Integrated Shield Plan coverage from April 1, 2023. Before the change, subsidised patients could claim up to $3,000 a month for their total cancer treatment costs. They may also use an additional $1,200 a month from MediSave. Since September, cancer treatment claims have been split \u2013 with separate claim limits for drugs and services. Patients can now claim $200 to $9,600 a month for one cancer drug treatment. They may also claim up to $1,200 a year for cancer services, which include consultations, scans, lab investigations, chemotherapy preparation and administration, supportive care drugs and blood transfusions. Up to $600 a year from MediSave may also be used. The Ministry of Health (MOH) had said that with the change, 90 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients would have their cancer bills fully subsidised, subject to the 10 per cent co-payment, which MediSave can pay for. Before the change, 70 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients had their cancer bills fully subsidised. But oncologists from the public sector have told the MOH that the $1,200 MediShield Life cap on cancer services is inadequate. Several oncologists told The Straits Times that almost half of subsidised cancer patients, who used to be fully covered, will face similar problems as Ms W. A check with various public hospitals showed that fees for a repeat consultation for subsidised patients range from $21.60 to $72.50. Lab tests, even with subsidies, often cost more than $100, and for some, will top $200. Often, these need to be done every few weeks. Some patients need medication for side effects of treatment, such as nausea or an elevated blood pressure, but such drugs also now come under cancer services. Some need antibiotics when their immune systems are compromised by the medication, and these too come under cancer services. Other procedures such as blood transfusions for patients with blood cancers also add to their costs. Several oncologists, who asked not to be named, said this is clearly not enough. One public sector oncologist said the coverage \u201cneeds to be multiple times the current cap\u201d. Ms W has no problems with cancer drug cost. It is with the cancer services that she finds her insurance coverage inadequate. By her December bill, she had used up the $1,200 yearly coverage limit for cancer services. Her bills for these services range from $400 to more than $800 each month, depending on the tests and medications she requires. The MOH said on Saturday that the MediShield Life cap on cancer services claims will be raised to $3,600 a year from April. But the cap on MediSave withdrawal for cancer services remains at $600 a year. On hearing this, Ms W said: \u201cI\u2019m glad to know that they are revising the current MediShield and MediSave coverage to better help cancer patients. I do hope that the revised amount can at least cover all the necessary tests and scans that we patients have to undergo on a frequent basis.\u201d But the higher cap \u2013 which works out to $300 from MediShield Life and $50 from MediSave a month \u2013 will still not be enough to cover her bills for cancer services. Ms W added: \u201cWith cancer, my life is already uncertain. Every time I do the test, I worry that my cancer might flare up again. Now, I also face financial problems. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to deal with it.\u201d Because of her illness, she has stopped full-time work and is currently working part-time. But this is enough to put her out of reach of MediFund aid, which is a government safety net for the poor. \u201cAt least if insurance can\u2019t pay for this, I should be allowed to use my MediSave. I may not have many more years to live. Why limit MediSave withdrawal to $600 a year?\u201d she asked. Click to expand...

Background info of my current place - 5 Room HDB, 1400 sq. ft range, with a L shape walkway into the bedrooms.

So I went ahead to order a set of gocoax MA2500D adapters and have to say they are a lifesaver, capable of the full 1Gbps speed(should be able to go higher since MoCa 2.5 supports up to 2.5G) but fibre plans in Singapore are mostly limited to 1Gbps only. The WiFi speed and coverage of the XT12 is really impressive. Now the whole place is place has no dead zones. My desktop in BR1 is hooked to the XT12 via LAN. But I was curious to see how fast it can go WiFi since my PC has an Intel AX200 WiFi card in there. Pretty shiok to see almost a full gigabit speed but on WiFi. Granted, the PC was quite near to the XT12 but call me suaku I am really impressed to see 900+ up/down. For my iPhone 13 in the same room, speed is about 700+ up, close to 700 down. So yea a short experience from myself. Looking  to see other users chime in with their experience.",2022-04-24T12:47:27,access to education

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE \u2013 Youth unemployment plunged to a 24-year low in 2022 thanks in part to a post-lockdown hiring spree among retail and food and beverage outlets regaining their footing after the Covid-19 pandemic. The jobless rate for Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 15 to 24 came in at just 5.9 per cent, down from 7.3 per cent in 2021 and the lowest point since the 4.3 per cent recorded in 1997. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday that last year\u2019s low unemployment could reflect the abundance of part-time or temporary jobs in sectors with low barriers of entry, such as retail and food and beverage, now that Covid-19 restrictions have eased. People who are still studying or in training and not looking for a job are not counted into the youth labour force. The ministry\u2019s full-year labour market report for 2022 also found that about 40 per cent of youth employees were in temporary posts or contract jobs, comprising mostly students working on the side. The ministry noted that 27 per cent of all young people in jobs were also in school or on vacation from classes. Full-timers formed around 73 per cent of all employed resident youth in June 2022, the report said, adding: \u201cWhen youths gained employment, they were likely to be in full-time positions. This share did not change significantly and was comparable to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019.\u201d The different needs of young people in the job market tend to push their unemployment rate higher than in other age groups. On one hand, there are fresh graduates entering the labour market as Singapore transitions out of the pandemic, while other youngsters explore different options to find a suitable job. Yet others frequently move between temporary or part-time jobs while studying. This is in line with what other countries have experienced, the ministry added. Nonetheless, 2022\u2019s 5.9 per cent unemployment rate was much lower than in previous downturns, such as the 8.8 per cent seen during the global financial crisis in 2009, it said. Singapore also fared well last year compared with other developed nations such as the United States, which notched a youth jobless rate of nearly 10 per cent, or Finland, where the rate exceeded 16 per cent, in 2021, said the ministry. \u201cYouth unemployment is mostly transitional and short-term,\u201d it added. Long-term unemployed youth, which refers to those unemployed for at least 25 weeks, made up 0.5 per cent of the youth labour force in 2022. This was lower than in the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis, the 2009 global financial crisis and in 2019 before the pandemic. Singapore\u2019s 2022 rate also compares favourably with 2021 figures from other developed economies such as France, Hong Kong and Britain, which posted rates between 3.9 per cent to 4.9 per cent, the ministry noted. The report also examined the proportion of the youth population who are not in employment, education or training (Neet). The figure provides a useful measure to understand the difficulty of finding a job for young people, as well as their likelihood of being \u201ceconomically idle\u201d, the ministry said. Singapore\u2019s rate of 4 per cent in 2022 shows that very few young people are not engaged in some form of employment or training, far fewer than that experienced by other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2021. It is also a significant decline from the 5.3 per cent measured at the height of the pandemic in 2020. The ministry said the low prevalence of Neet youth is testament to the quality of Singapore\u2019s education system, and suggests that \u201ceconomic idleness\u2019\u201d was less of an issue here. \u201cTaken together with Singapore\u2019s good international standing in terms of low unemployment and long-term unemployment rates, the favourable labour market outcomes of our youths attest to our quality education and training system.\u201d",2023-03-16T16:58:35,low income

BTO rules tightening: Home buyers worry they may be forced to choose a 'bad flat' Applicants for Build-To-Order flats say that if they do not get a ""good queue number"", they can only choose from what some might see as less desirable flats, such as those on lower floors. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: Flat applicants could find themselves in a quandary with the latest change in Build-To-Order (BTO) rules to penalise those who reject a flat. A first-time applicant, who wanted to be known only as Mr Oh, told CNA he was given a queue number to select a flat in the February 2022 BTO launch. But he did not want to as only second- and third-floor flats were left to choose from. He had little to lose by doing so, as current rules allow potential flat buyers to refuse twice before they lose their priority status as a first-timer. First-timers get two ballot chances instead of one, and up to 95 per cent of the BTO flat supply is reserved for them. When asked if he would have done the same under new rules announced on Thursday (Mar 2), Mr Oh said he might have had no choice but to pick a flat. He would not want to lose his first-timer priority status as he has a child and needs a home, he said. The 33-year-old later selected a four-room flat in the May BTO launch as he got a \u201cgood queue number\u201d. In a tightening of rules due to high demand, first-time BTO flat applicants who decline to select a flat when invited to do so will lose their priority status for a year. This takes effect from the August 2023 sales exercise. They can still apply for a new HDB flat, but the flat allocation quota for second-timers is lower, Minister of National Development Desmond Lee said when announcing the change. Second-timers who reject a flat when invited to do so will not be allowed to participate in HDB sales exercises for one year. Currently, this only kicks in after they decline to book a flat twice. BTO applicants get a queue number based on balloting and if there are units left when their number comes around, they are invited to select a flat. The number of applicants typically exceeds the number of flats available by multiple times, especially for popular locations in mature estates. The difference in chances between first-timers and second-timers is stark. Taking Mr Oh's case, there were 2.5 first-time applicants vying for each four-room flat in Yishun during the sales exercise in February last year. But for second-timers, the rate was 16.2 In the May launch, the ratio was 9.4 first-timers versus 28.4 second-timers for each four-room flat at the Yishun Beacon BTO development. The chances may seem slim with such a high number of applicants for a limited supply of flats. But even if an applicant had a queue number of 150 and only 100 flats were available, they might still get to choose a flat, as according to the HDB, 40 per cent of applicants give up their chance when their turn comes. Authorities have said that there are many reasons for this. Some, like Mr Oh, did not like the flats left for them to choose from, some simply do not turn up for their appointments, others hedge their bets and may have other housing options. ""My HDB colleagues also shared that some applicants may be rather selective, wanting only flats on high floors,"" said Mr Lee at the Committee of Supply debate on Thursday. \u201cFor some, the remaining flats may be out of their budget. For others, they might be considering other housing options, or prefer flats with specific attributes for specific reasons. ""But whatever the reason, such applicants do crowd out other homebuyers who may have more pressing needs."" To be fair to applicants at the back of the queue, Mr Lee said HDB will waive the penalty for non-selection if an applicant has 10 or fewer flats to choose from. For Sales of Balance flat exercises, where the supply is much smaller, this threshold is set at five or fewer flats. Although Mr Oh once refused to choose a flat, he is in favour of the move as it will deter people who \u201cjust apply for fun\u201d, he said. Another BTO applicant who asked to be referred to as Madam Seah said she applied for a flat in the last two launches. Although the new rule will not affect her, she empathised with families who did not want flats with undesirable attributes. \u201cThere\u2019s no point choosing a place you don\u2019t like,\u201d she said, giving examples of flats on low floors, west-facing units that get too much sunlight and flats near rubbish collection areas. The 52-year-old asked if there were other ways to weed out buyers who \u201cjust want to profit\u201d from their first BTO flat. Another applicant Timothy Eng, 29, said he wants a flat that he is \u201chappier with\u201d rather than one with \u201cnot-so-good attributes\u201d. If the units left were not to his liking, he said he would opt for a resale flat instead. \u201cI think that if your queue number is outside of the number of flats, it is a bit unfair. It may make sense if you are within the queue numbers, but to be penalised because you don\u2019t want to choose a bad flat if that is all you are left with is not the fairest,\u201d Mr Eng said. \u201cIt may become harder to change homes in the future, especially if you are stuck with a not-so-good flat.\u201d FEWER APPLICANTS FROM AUGUST: ANALYSTS\u200b Property analysts said they expect to see fewer applicants for BTO flats from the August launch onwards due to this change in rules. Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research at Huttons, said this is a \u201cgood step towards improving accessibility to a BTO flat which is a public good\u201d. \u201cApplicants do not select a flat for various reasons \u2026 since they intend to stay there for many years, they would want to choose the best unit in their view. To those with a genuine reason, they will feel aggrieved at this change,\u201d he said. Huttons estimated that the number of applicants for the August 2023 BTO launch may fall by as much as 20 per cent. Some analysts said it may create a rush to apply for flats at the February and May 2023 launches before the new rule kicks in. Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty Network, said that the new rule will force BTO applicants to think carefully before they apply, and may boost demand for resale flats. \u201cWhen this new rule comes into effect from August 2023 onwards, the number of BTO applications may temporarily decrease as only the more serious BTO flat buyers will apply,\u201d he said. Applicants, especially second-timers, who had one non-selection count may turn to the HDB resale market, he added. But this increased demand may not last, said Dr Tan Tee Khoon, Singapore country manager at PropertyGuru. \u201cThe market will likely recalibrate and stabilise by next year after some volatility as home seekers grow accustomed to the new regulations,\u201d said Dr Tan. WHO MAY DROP OUT?\u200b Ms Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, said that many buyers who do not have urgent housing needs will likely hold back their applications. \u201cThe applicants who may drop out include those who have applied many times as they were targeting popular mature estates or certain flat types, which are deemed to yield better investment returns,\u201d said Ms Sun. \u201cOthers could be undergraduates or courting couples who may not be ready to get married but have applied to secure units earlier.\u201d In 2018, HDB allowed younger couples aged at least 21 years old to defer the assessment of their income and apply for flats early, so more undergraduates and national servicemen may have joined the queue, she said, adding that some could have withdrawn their applications when the relationship soured. \u201cNow many may hold back their applications until they are committed to the relationship and are ready to settle down,\u201d she said. Other housing policy changes were announced at the Budget 2023 speech on Feb 14 and the Committee of Supply debate for the Ministry of National Development on Thursday. A new First-Timer (Parents & Married Couples) or FT(PMC) priority category has been created. Applicants in this category \u2013 first-timers who have children and married couples aged 40 and below \u2013 get three ballot chances instead of two. Eligible first-timers buying resale flats will also get a boost in the CPF Housing Grant amount of up to S$30,000. \u200b",2023-03-03T15:17:19,income inequality

If not, a simple solution lies ahead: Doing it yourself. Screengrabs of this reporter's WhatsApp conversations with the degree certificate forgers. CASES IN THE NEWS\u200b In recent years, several people in Singapore have made headlines for forging or using forged educational qualifications to secure jobs, including high-paying ones. These ranged from O-Level and A-Level certificates to degree certificates from NTU or the National University of Singapore (NUS), for example. Their modus operandi was generally similar: Using Photoshop or similar photo-editing applications to insert their own name into existing templates online, or tweaking their own documents to plump up their resume. In January, a woman was jailed for forgery after using the Microsoft Paint application to doctor an O-Level certificate in support of her application to become a pre-school principal. Last November, news surfaced of a man who had forged degree certificates for subjects like engineering and law since 2009 to get well-paying jobs. His offences only came to light in 2020 when a construction firm checked with NTU about his qualifications. One employer told CNA that he came across a similar case several years ago. It was a simple task involving project management, but a new hire began giving \u201cvery lame\u201d excuses as to why he could not complete it, said CHH Construction & Security Systems director Tee Wei Kang. This immediately roused suspicions. There was no reason that the employee, Chin Ming Lik \u2013 who was drawing a monthly salary of around S$7,000 \u2013 was unable to do that. After all, he had listed several reputable construction firms in his resume. The company investigated and discovered that Chin had faked multiple documents and credentials. But it decided to give him a chance and not report him to the police. \u201cFortunately, one of our HR managers was friends with middle management in a company that he referenced in his resume. So she asked for a favour from a friend to check his past employment history,\u201d Mr Tee said. He added that most of the past jobs Chin had listed were in \u201cmuch, much larger companies\u201d, which made it more difficult to verify them. Chin went on to cheat more companies, until a firm checked the authenticity of his NUS civil engineering degree certificate in late 2016. His multiple acts of forgery finally landed him in jail . Chin used the fake documents to secure employment at 38 companies, earning monthly salaries ranging from S$3,500 to S$9,000. He had heard that project managers in civil engineering drew good salaries and he wanted to obtain such jobs. Despite being cheated by Chin, Mr Tee said that verifying educational certificates is \u201cfairly straightforward\u201d in Singapore, given that there are not that many tertiary institutions here. Most of the forgery cases he has seen involve foreign employees. As for professional qualifications, such as electrical skills required for construction work, Mr Tee pointed out that these have to come from testing centres directly under the Ministry of Manpower\u2019s purview. \u201cFor local certificates, no matter how hard they try to forge it, if you do a simple check and reference check, it\u2019s very easy to see whether the certificate is fake or not.\u201d A sample of a fake Nanyang Technological University degree, sent to this reporter by a forger online. TECH ADVANCES BOTH BOON AND BANE\u200b Other employers and human resources experts told CNA that technology has made it easier for people to make fake documents, but educational institutions and training providers have also used technology to make it harder for their certificates to be forged. Ms Linda Teo, country manager of recruitment firm ManpowerGroup Singapore, noted that jobseekers need not provide original copies of their certificates at the initial stages of hiring because more companies are accepting applications via digital platforms. \u201cMany jobseekers may be tempted to submit fake qualifications to try their luck at securing jobs than what they are qualified for. ""However, educational institutions and training providers are implementing more measures to make it harder for their certificates to be forged,\u201d she said. One such measure is tapping blockchain technology to make certificates tamper-resistant. Others issue serial numbers for their certificates which can be verified on their websites. Many educational institutions have implemented the OpenCerts format \u2013 which uses blockchain \u2013 to verify their graduates\u2019 transcripts, said Ms Zen Soh, manager of commerce finance at Robert Walters Singapore. These include all five polytechnics, the six autonomous universities, the Institute of Technical Education and Lasalle College of the Arts. For example, NUS states on its website that it issues \u201cverifiable electric degree scrolls/graduate diplomas and official transcripts\u201d to undergraduates admitted from 2005 onwards, as well as those admitted for higher degree studies from 2004 onwards. Graduates can share the digital files with third parties, such as prospective employers, who can easily check the authenticity of their qualifications on the OpenCert website.

This new requirement, which also applies to domestic helpers, is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses as medical costs rise, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday, highlighting that more than 5 per cent of foreign workers\u2019 medical bills exceed the current $15,000 coverage limit. An average of more than 1,000 employers a year face this issue, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament in March 2022, when he announced the move for additional insurance coverage. MOM estimates that more than 99 per cent of bills for hospitalisation and surgical procedures will fall within the new coverage limit. Under the new rules, employers also have to co-pay 25 per cent of claim amounts that go above the first $15,000. This means that if a worker incurs a $60,000 bill for heart surgery, for instance, the employer will have to pay $11,250, which is 25 per cent of $45,000. The insurer will cover the other $48,750. From July 2025, several other changes will also be implemented. Employers will no longer need to pay for their workers\u2019 medical treatment upfront and claim the amount from insurers later. Insurers will be required to reimburse hospitals directly. There will also be a standard list of allowable exclusions for insurers, such as procedures that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery. Insurers will not have to cover the treatments for pre-existing illnesses occurring within the first 12 months of work under the same employer. Insurers must also offer different premiums for workers aged 50 and below, and those above the age of 50, from July 2025. There were 1,033,500 work permit holders \u2013 of whom 268,500 were maids \u2013 and 177,900 S Pass holders working in Singapore as at the end of last year. Medical bills of migrant workers are not subsidised or covered under national schemes such as MediShield Life and MediFund. MOM said the policy changes are being implemented in phases to give employers and insurers time to adjust to the cost impact. The ministry added: \u201cWith many insurers expressing interest to offer the enhanced medical insurance products, the market will be competitive and employers will have a range of insurers to choose from.\u201d Employers must provide medical insurance coverage of at least $60,000 for maids, migrant workers from July This is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses, said MOM.

But this reaction is stereotyping at work, says June Yong. Commentary: Full subject-based banding will only work if we stop categorising students Parents may worry if their children will be distracted by disruptive classmates when full subject-based banding and mixed form classes take effect. But this reaction is stereotyping at work, says June Yong. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: The full subject-based banding (SBB) system that will kick in nationwide for secondary school students in 2024 promises to usher in a new era of a strength-based approach to learning. Along with it, the old labels of Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) will no longer be used to build walls around groups of students. But the question is, will these walls remain in our minds? HOW FULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING WORKS\u200b Students entering secondary schools next year will no longer be sorted into Express and Normal streams. Instead, each student will take most subjects at either the G3, G2 or G1 level, which is mapped from today\u2019s Express, N(A) and N(T) standards, depending on their performance in the subject. Form classes are expected to have roughly equal proportions of G3 students and G1 or G2 students, depending on the school\u2019s makeup. They will take certain subjects together with their form class, such as PE, Art and character and citizenship education. But when it comes to mathematics, science and languages, the students will be split according to the subject level they are taking. I admit that my own first reaction to SBB was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be mayhem to lump the different students together in one class? How would the teachers teach?\u201d I had to call myself out for automatically assuming that the students who would take most of their subjects at the G1 or G2 levels would be the naughtier ones. Mr Tan, a teacher whose school has been piloting SBB for the past three years, shared that very often when teachers walk into a new class, they cannot tell the difference between the students in the Express stream and those in the Normal streams. Over time, certain differences may emerge - for example, Express-stream students may be more concerned about their academic performance, while their N(A) and N(T) counterparts may be less interested in their studies or may not follow instructions as readily, he described. But he added a caveat that this could also be stereotyping at work, admitting that both groups of students are more similar than we think. For example, he once met a student who was very well behaved and polite, and later found out that this student was from the N(T) stream. Such experiences have helped him realise that these categories really do not matter. THE BEAUTY OF SUBJECT-BASED BANDING\u200b When it comes to understanding the whys behind this new system, no one can fault its aim to remove the stigma of unhelpful labels that have resulted in a division between \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d at such a formative age. SBB treats every student as an individual, and seeks to maximise each person\u2019s potential. At the same time, I have heard many parents voice their worry about whether their children will end up being inadvertently taxed in this new system. One common concern is that they may end up being distracted by their naughtier classmates. But is this phenomenon of having disruptive classmates new? Would it be caused solely by the SBB system itself? That we seem to fall back on the trope that lower-ability students behave poorly may be reflective of how sticky the old labels are and how much persistence is required to scrub them off. To prod us along, we may need to revisit the benefits of heterogeneous classrooms. Diversity in a mixed classroom allows students to learn from one another\u2019s differences. In such a setting, there is also the potential for role modelling to take place, as weaker students learn from positive behaviours in class. According to Mr Tan\u2019s observations of his mixed form classes, the children actually get along with one other. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long for the students themselves to realise that different people have different gifts. Whereas in the old system, they\u2019re always made to believe that the one is better, and the other, worse.\u201d \u201cIf they can co-exist in this space, it will help them later on when they enter the workplace. They can hang out with anyone,\u201d he said. RISING TO THE CHALLENGE OF MIXED FORM CLASSES\u200b But friendships aside, it will remain to be seen as to whether the classroom setting will truly be more egalitarian and stigma-free. And this is where the skill level of educators comes in. In one research study, Stanford University researchers Elizabeth Cohen and Rachel Lotan hypothesised that teachers could affect students\u2019 perceptions of status in a heterogeneous classroom by altering the expectations of competence that students hold for themselves and for one another. They proposed two interventions: The multiple ability intervention and assigning competence to low-status students. The former entails discussing the many different intellectual abilities required by collective tasks, such as reasoning or problem-solving. The latter involves the teacher, after having observed instances of low-status students performing well on abilities relevant to the task, providing the student with specific, positive and public evaluations. The researchers found that the interventions were effective in promoting equal-status behaviour in the classroom, and clocked significant gains in participation and achievement of low-status students. This study shows that the role of the educator is particularly important in ensuring that classrooms are safe and effective learning spaces for all. While there may no longer be different streams, teachers are the first ones who have to fully embrace SBB and take intentional steps to ensure that lower-ability learners in their form classes are valued for their strengths. And because it might be more difficult to engage everyone equally, it may also mean that form teachers will need to give themselves time to understand their students better and to adjust their teaching methods accordingly. HELPING EVERY STUDENT FIND THEIR PLACE\u200b In the new system, everyone has a part to play. \u201cBeing a form teacher of a mixed class has made me realise that many of the kids are talented in different areas,\u201d explained Mr Tan. \u201cSome of the lower-ability students have very strong leadership traits. Some of them are showmen who are not afraid of going on stage and expressing themselves. They end up being the cheerleaders in class.\u201d While it is easy to reach for labels to help explain the different behaviours we may come across in class, it may be even better to focus on each student as an individual with different strengths, weaknesses and needs. \u201cIt has also made me realise that categorising them is really my problem. We need to shift gears and help them find the thing they\u2019re good at,\u201d he added. June Yong is the Lead of Insights at Focus on the Family Singapore.",2023-03-08T08:18:46,middle class

Specifically I'm looking for hospitalization insurance. I tried NTUC Income but got rejected because I have a pre-existing anxiety disorder. I was really surprised that they rejected to cover me even for emergency hospitalisations rather than exclude the condition only. So right now as a foreigner I'm stuck with no hospitalisation insurance which is really adding to my anxiety. Can the more experienced here suggest what other options I could try to atleast get cover for hospitalisation in case of accidents(serious, moderate or minor)? Moreover, what would happen if I didnt declare, had an expensive hospitalisation due to an accident/emergency at a restructured/public hospital and filed a claim? Lastly, would personal accident plans help in this situation? Thanks in advance!",2020-06-16T00:33:26,medical expenses

Called Single Room Shared Facilities, this new housing type aims to give tenants greater privacy while providing a community-type living environment, said the Housing Board on Monday. HDB will pilot the initiative at the former Anderson Junior College hostel in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8, which comprises two 11-storey blocks. The site will be able to house 480 tenants in single rooms, fully partitioned out of 240 units. Each room, about 9 sq m, will come fitted with basic furnishings such a single-size bed frame, wardrobe, table, chair, wall shelves and a mini refrigerator. Tenants will have to buy their own mattress for hygiene reasons, said HDB. The 24 tenants on each level will share common facilities such as toilets, and kitchens equipped with five cooking stoves, sinks and cabinets. They will also share laundry and activity rooms, as well as dining areas repurposed from former study rooms. This set-up is unlike the Joint Singles Scheme Operator-Run model implemented in end-2021, which pairs singles to share a one- or two-room HDB flat which are semi-partitioned. Speaking to reporters after a tour of a sample unit, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the former hostel site was picked to reduce the preparation time to start the pilot as HDB could \u201cmake do with the existing infrastructure and make adjustments to it\u201d. \u201cIf we do make this a permanent feature of our rental flat offerings, there will be of course changes to the configurations and the ratio (of tenants to facilities). This is using existing infrastructure and making do with what we have to test out this model,\u201d he added. Mr Lee said the pilot will run for one to two years for HDB to collect data on whether the model will work, and if it should be included among the Government\u2019s public rental schemes. The former hostel site is currently still being fitted out, and singles will be able to apply individually in end-2023 when it is ready. The prevailing public rental eligibility criteria for singles will apply. An operator will be appointed to manage the site, including managing tenancy matters and providing social support, as well as furnishing and maintaining the premises, said HDB.

This comes as Singapore's consumer price index (CPI) for all items between July and December last year rose by 3.1 per cent year on year , which is double the 1.5 per cent increase in the first half of last year. The index is used as a measure of consumer price inflation. For those whose household incomes were in the lowest 20 per cent bracket, the CPI for all items rose by 2.4 per cent year on year during the period, compared to 2.7 per cent for the middle 60 per cent in household income, and 3.7 per cent for the highest 20 per cent in household income. Excluding rentals on owner-occupied accommodation, the CPI for the lowest, middle, and highest income groups rose by 2.3 per cent, 2.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent year on year respectively. The main contributors to the higher inflation rates were cars, accommodation, petrol, food and electricity, but these price increases were partially offset by lower costs of telecommunication services and clothing and footwear. The lowest income group saw the smallest increase in inflation rates as the increase in car and petrol prices had less of an impact on them. Pump prices rose from $2.42 to $2.47 on July 2 last year to $2.55 to $2.57 per litre on Dec 28 for 92-octane petrol, while prices for 95-octane prices increased from $2.44 to $2.54 per litre to $2.58 to $2.61 over the same period. Out of the three income groups, those in the lowest income bracket spend the highest proportion of their income on housing and utilities, as well as on food. In contrast, the highest income group spent a larger proportion of their income on cars and petrol compared to the lowest and middle income groups. Associate Professor Yeo Wee Yong from the National University of Singapore's finance department said the prices of items such as cars, petrol and electricity tend to affect higher income groups more. ""Although food prices increased as well, prices of items such as clothing, footwear and telecommunication services that may also take up a big proportion of the income of lower income groups fell,"" he said. Inflation is set to be a key challenge in 2022, as prices rise across different consumer goods, exacerbated by supply chain disruptions, border restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic and an impending hike in the Singapore goods and services tax from 7 per cent to 9 per cent.

The professional conversion programme (PCP) for interior fit-out specialists will take in the first cohort by July and aims to place 70 trainees over the next two years. It will nurture a pipeline of local specialists to handle interior fitting services, such as the customising and installing of furniture on-site at commercial and residential projects. The training programme was introduced by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC) Institute, a training solutions provider, at a virtual event on Wednesday (June 02). It is expected to meet the growing demands of Singapore's interior fit-out business segment, valued at about $3 billion a year. Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and National Development Sim Ann, who is the council's patron, said the furniture and furnishings industry has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the fit-out sector facing labour constraints. ""By retraining and upskilling our local talent with specific skillsets in interior fit-out, enterprises can build a pipeline of specialists who can support their growth aspirations,"" she noted, adding that the move would make the profession more attractive for the younger generation. An interior fit-out specialist performs tasks like project management, on-site supervision, advising on design and materials selection, and interpreting designs and translating them into production. It is a step-up from the role of an installer, who assists in projects by ensuring an area is ready before an installation and fitting out cabinets and wardrobes. SFIC president Phua Boon Huat said the new generation of installers will require greater skills than before. ""With the evolving landscape, certain roles within our industry are changing quickly,"" he explained. He cited an example of how designers may now upgrade their skills to take on hybrid roles as designers-cum-installers. ""Understanding how fabrication, assembly and installation work will make a designer become more adept and all-rounded at his or her job, and consequently improve productivity for the company,"" he added. Mr Phua said the PCP will help build a strong Singapore core to ensure the continuity of businesses and renovation projects, particularly with the ongoing pandemic. During the nine-month programme, trainees will learn about construction technology, production processes, technical drawings, furniture installation, and advance construction methods in furniture making, among other things. They will also be equipped with soft skills in negotiation, project risk management, teamwork and handling client relationships. This will be done through classroom and workshop-based learning, as well as on-the-job training. WSG chief executive Tan Choon Shian said technology has accelerated the transformation of the traditionally labour-intensive sector. ""This PCP allows the next generation of installers to take on higher value roles in using advanced technology, and skillsets in client and project management,"" he added. At the launch event, 10 local firms signed a memorandum of understanding with the SFIC Institute to take on new hires under the programme. Mr Michael Soh, managing director of interior fittings manufacturer Redwood Interior, one of the participating firms, said that given Singapore's manpower constraints, the programme will upskill workers and equip them with the know-how to operate advanced machinery, thereby increasing their productivity. Among those keen on joining the PCP is Mr Joey Tay, a former furniture designer turned workshop manager. He said the programme would help participants acquire in-demand skills ""required to enter this industry and carve out a fulfilling career"".

The latest figure, announced Friday, is lower than Singapore's previous low of 1.1 set in 2020 and lower than Japan's 2021 level. The resident total fertility rate refers to the average number of live births a woman has during her reproductive years. Indranee Rajah, who serves as minister in the Prime Minister's Office, told a parliamentary committee that the falling fertility rate was because of people marrying later and parents caring for older family members at the same time as children as the population grays. The decline also was partly due to the Year of the Tiger ""in the lunar calendar, which is generally associated with lower births among the Chinese,"" the minister said. But critics point to a high cost of living in the city state as a deeper cause. About 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing under the Housing & Development Board (HDB). Prices of these homes continue to rise, which contributes to couples waiting longer to marry and start a family. In this month's budget proposal, the government called for bigger cash payouts at birth, a doubling of parental leave for fathers and increased support for HDB home purchases. A total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered ""replacement level,"" which represents the average number of children a woman would need to have to reproduce herself by bearing a daughter who survives to childbearing age, according to the United Nations. Singapore is not the only Asian economy facing demographic headwinds. South Korea's total fertility rate fell to a new low of 0.78 last year, the lowest out of the 38 members of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Japan, which had a fertility rate of 1.3 in 2021, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government has vowed to increase the budget for child rearing support .",2023-02-26T11:05:13,parental occupation

Wages for those earning less than 2,500 Singapore dollars ($1,815) a month rose by only 2.5% between May last year and this year, the study showed. That's lower than the country's average consumer price index inflation of 5.2% in the first half of 2022. In contrast, customers earning S$5,000 to S$7,499 had wage increases of 11.1%, and those paid S$10,000 and above received a 13.6% raise in the same period, the report stated. ""Customers earning below S$2,500 are usually elderly residents who have a lower earning capability or workers who are in lower skilled professions,"" said Irvin Seah, senior economist at DBS Group Research. The study of 1.2 million DBS retail customers showed that despite improvements in salary and employment benefits, the income of nearly half of the respondents fell behind inflation. However, Seah said low wage earners receive government financial support, which creates more disposable income for this group of workers. If the bank included customers upward income mobility, which refers to a person's income progressively increasing over the course of their life, ""then overall income growth for the lower income group would be more encouraging at 19.2% year on year,"" Seah told CNBC in an email. Growing expenses\u200b On top of slower wage growth, those in the lower-income group face increasing expenses, which have risen by a bigger factor than those with higher salaries. Expenses for Singaporeans earning less than S$2,500 grew 13.8% between May 2021 and May this year \u20145.6 times more than their income growth of 2.5%, the study showed. For Singaporeans earning S$5,000 to S$7,499, expenses grew 2.2 times faster than their income growth of 11.1%. Those earning S$10,000 and above saw their expenses increase 1.8 times faster than their income growth of 13.6%, the bank said. ""Expenses for the higher income is rising at twice the speed of their income growth [versus 5.6 times] for the lower income. Such [a] trend for the lower income is obviously not sustainable unless there is significant improvement in income growth or upward income mobility,"" Seah said. Spending habits\u200b Rising inflation and the economic reopening from the pandemic have led to an increase in household expenses. DBS said its customers are now spending 64% of their income, up from 59% a year ago. Expenses for millennials (those between 26 and 41 years old), who have been spending more as the economy reopened after Covid restrictions were eased, rose by almost 30% over the past year. The growth in expenses for baby boomers (58 to 76 years old) was smaller. A majority of baby boomers are retirees and ""hence, on an aggregate basis, the income growth would be naturally lower,"" Seah said. There was double-digit growth across all spending categories. The biggest growth in expenses was observed in transportation, shopping, entertainment and food. Inflation outlook\u200b Inflation in Singapore hit a 13-year high of 4.4% in June, a 0.8% increase from the previous month. Seah said inflation could peak in the third quarter of the year and ease in November. High prices will stick around the next two to three years but the inflation rate will slow, he adds. Singaporeans with low incomes continue to face the lowest wage growth, DBS says Low-income earners in Singapore will face the lowest growth in wages and the biggest jump in household expenses as inflation rises, according to DBS. www.cnbc.com",2022-08-05T12:14:16,low income

US$700. How long would it take? Two to three days, plus a few more days for shipping. How genuine would it look? \u201cWe make it according to the original, using the original paper and real seal,\u201d one forger wrote in a text message. \u201cMany customers used our documents to apply (for) jobs and they succeeded.\u201d When asked for a sample of the forged degree certificate, all four providers contacted by CNA were more than willing to oblige. The samples looked startlingly identical to this reporter\u2019s own Nanyang Technological University (NTU) certificate, though the initial price seemed staggering. \u201cIt's a lot of money, I think I can't afford it. Can it be any lower?\u201d I asked. The response: \u201cSorry this is a discount price. You can pay half as deposit first, check the digital version then pay the rest.\u201d A few hours later, the price was lowered to US$630 with an additional comment: \u201cThis is the best I can do.\u201d A sample of a fake Nanyang Technological University degree, sent to this reporter over WhatsApp. This reporter's genuine degree certificate from Nanyang Technological University. Two others quoted the same price of US$700 while another said it would cost me US$750. Naturally, none of them accepted payment via credit card, with the common methods being international wire transfers or Paypal. They also provided \u201corder forms\u201d for me to fill in with details like my desired admission and graduation date, degree title, major and student identification number. These forgery services were readily available through websites that popped up in a simple Google search. While most of the mobile numbers provided on the sites had Hong Kong area codes, it was impossible to tell whether the printers are truly situated there. But one thing is for sure \u2013 it remains extremely easy to get your hands on a fake degree certificate. That is, if you are willing to pay almost a thousand dollars. If not, a simple solution lies ahead: Doing it yourself. Screengrabs of this reporter's WhatsApp conversations with the degree certificate forgers. CASES IN THE NEWS\u200b In recent years, several people in Singapore have made headlines for forging or using forged educational qualifications to secure jobs, including high-paying ones. These ranged from O-Level and A-Level certificates to degree certificates from NTU or the National University of Singapore (NUS), for example. Their modus operandi was generally similar: Using Photoshop or similar photo-editing applications to insert their own name into existing templates online, or tweaking their own documents to plump up their resume. In January, a woman was jailed for forgery after using the Microsoft Paint application to doctor an O-Level certificate in support of her application to become a pre-school principal. Last November, news surfaced of a man who had forged degree certificates for subjects like engineering and law since 2009 to get well-paying jobs. His offences only came to light in 2020 when a construction firm checked with NTU about his qualifications. One employer told CNA that he came across a similar case several years ago. It was a simple task involving project management, but a new hire began giving \u201cvery lame\u201d excuses as to why he could not complete it, said CHH Construction & Security Systems director Tee Wei Kang. This immediately roused suspicions. There was no reason that the employee, Chin Ming Lik \u2013 who was drawing a monthly salary of around S$7,000 \u2013 was unable to do that. After all, he had listed several reputable construction firms in his resume. The company investigated and discovered that Chin had faked multiple documents and credentials. But it decided to give him a chance and not report him to the police. \u201cFortunately, one of our HR managers was friends with middle management in a company that he referenced in his resume. So she asked for a favour from a friend to check his past employment history,\u201d Mr Tee said. He added that most of the past jobs Chin had listed were in \u201cmuch, much larger companies\u201d, which made it more difficult to verify them. Chin went on to cheat more companies, until a firm checked the authenticity of his NUS civil engineering degree certificate in late 2016. His multiple acts of forgery finally landed him in jail . Chin used the fake documents to secure employment at 38 companies, earning monthly salaries ranging from S$3,500 to S$9,000. He had heard that project managers in civil engineering drew good salaries and he wanted to obtain such jobs. Despite being cheated by Chin, Mr Tee said that verifying educational certificates is \u201cfairly straightforward\u201d in Singapore, given that there are not that many tertiary institutions here. Most of the forgery cases he has seen involve foreign employees. As for professional qualifications, such as electrical skills required for construction work, Mr Tee pointed out that these have to come from testing centres directly under the Ministry of Manpower\u2019s purview. \u201cFor local certificates, no matter how hard they try to forge it, if you do a simple check and reference check, it\u2019s very easy to see whether the certificate is fake or not.\u201d A sample of a fake Nanyang Technological University degree, sent to this reporter by a forger online. TECH ADVANCES BOTH BOON AND BANE\u200b Other employers and human resources experts told CNA that technology has made it easier for people to make fake documents, but educational institutions and training providers have also used technology to make it harder for their certificates to be forged. Ms Linda Teo, country manager of recruitment firm ManpowerGroup Singapore, noted that jobseekers need not provide original copies of their certificates at the initial stages of hiring because more companies are accepting applications via digital platforms. \u201cMany jobseekers may be tempted to submit fake qualifications to try their luck at securing jobs than what they are qualified for. ""However, educational institutions and training providers are implementing more measures to make it harder for their certificates to be forged,\u201d she said. One such measure is tapping blockchain technology to make certificates tamper-resistant. Others issue serial numbers for their certificates which can be verified on their websites. Many educational institutions have implemented the OpenCerts format \u2013 which uses blockchain \u2013 to verify their graduates\u2019 transcripts, said Ms Zen Soh, manager of commerce finance at Robert Walters Singapore. These include all five polytechnics, the six autonomous universities, the Institute of Technical Education and Lasalle College of the Arts. For example, NUS states on its website that it issues \u201cverifiable electric degree scrolls/graduate diplomas and official transcripts\u201d to undergraduates admitted from 2005 onwards, as well as those admitted for higher degree studies from 2004 onwards. Graduates can share the digital files with third parties, such as prospective employers, who can easily check the authenticity of their qualifications on the OpenCert website.

As part of the Government's pandemic response, COVID-19 treatments were p www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: As Singapore progressively returns to normal and the population learns to live with COVID-19, related coronavirus treatment financing schemes will be updated, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Jun 10). As part of the Government's pandemic response, COVID-19 treatments were provided ""at a very low fee or free of charge"", said MOH in a multi-ministerial task force press release. This was beyond existing healthcare support in the form of Government Subsidies, MediSave, MediShield Life and MediFund (S+3Ms). ""As life reverts to normal and we increasingly live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, we will need to progressively scale back the pandemic subsidy policy, and revert to the S+3Ms healthcare financing frameworks,"" said the ministry. PHPC, POLYCLINIC SUBSIDIES\u200b Since February 2020, more than 1,000 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) have been activated to provide subsidised care for patients with respiratory infection symptoms, whether due to COVID-19 or not. Singapore residents pay a flat subsidised rate of S$10 while Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors are charged a lower rate of S$5. From Jul 1, subsidies at PHPCs and polyclinics for the treatment of respiratory infections will revert to pre-COVID-19 levels. The subsidised fees will no longer apply, but Singaporeans will continue to receive prevailing subsidies under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) at CHAS general practitioner (GP) clinics. This does not affect antigen rapid tests (ARTs) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. PHPCs and polyclinics will continue to provide government-funded swabs to eligible symptomatic individuals at no charge, said MOH. TELEMEDICINE FOR PROTOCOL 2 INDIVIDUALS\u200b Currently, Protocol 2 cases who request telemedicine care enjoy full subsidies. Protocol 2 cases are those who are mildly symptomatic, low risk, and recovering from COVID-19 at home . MOH said it will revert the subsidy policy to pre-COVID-19 arrangements from Jul 1. Full subsidy for telemedicine will cease, but Singaporeans will continue receiving CHAS subsidies if they visit a CHAS GP clinic for treatment. Individuals under Protocol 1 - those at high medical risk or with severe symptoms, but are discharged home for recovery and under telemedicine surveillance - will continue to enjoy fully subsidised telemedicine care. TREATMENT COVERAGE IN HOSPITALS\u200b Singaporeans, permanent residents or long-term pass holders who seek emergency treatment for COVID-19 at emergency departments of public hospitals currently do not have to pay any emergency department charges. This is only for those who are fully vaccinated, or certified to be medically ineligible for vaccination. From Jul 1, this will no longer apply to those who do not require admission after visiting the emergency department. MOH said this move will help them manage the demand for such services. Those who are assessed to require hospital or COVID-19 treatment facility admission will continue to have their emergency department, inpatient and/or treatment facility bills fully subsidised by the government. Only those who are fully vaccinated or certified to be medically ineligible for vaccination are eligible for this subsidy. As part of ongoing COVID-19 surveillance, MOH said it will continue to monitor for virus strains introduced into and circulating in the community by requiring some infected individuals to take an additional government-funded PCR swab for genomic sequencing. ""Our daily caseloads have remained under control even with the significant easing of our community (safe management measures) and border measures. However, new variants will continue to emerge, and we must stay vigilant,"" said the Health Ministry. ""We urge everyone to still take the necessary precautions and remain socially responsible to protect themselves and others, even as we move towards normalcy and living safely with COVID-19.""",2022-06-10T20:47:23,Community Health Assit Scheme

""When we first started looking at this phenomenon, it was way back in the late 1990s and 2000s when we saw the inflow of foreign brides. ""When we mentioned foreign brides (in the past), we thought of women with low socio-economic status from the region who enter into marriages because of their families' financial circumstances."" But she said that the demographic profile has changed over the past 20 years, with economic growth in the region bringing greater educational and economic opportunities in their home countries. Prof Straughan said the result is that foreign wives are better educated. Separately, the number of Singaporean men who are less educated and who may have difficulties finding a local wife has shrunk, she added. Social workers have long raised concerns over transnational marriages involving older and less educated Singaporean men marrying young foreign women after a brief courtship.

Recently, I took my 19-year-old daughter who had a fever of 37.8 deg C to Bukit Batok Polyclinic and was told to queue for a time slot to see the doctor. But we ended up not getting a time slot because my daughter was not considered a priority case, as she was neither a child nor an elderly person running a high fever. While I acknowledge the need for prioritisation in a busy healthcare system, I am concerned that this may prevent people from accessing the healthcare they need, particularly for minor illnesses that could escalate into more serious conditions. For many families, polyclinics may be their only option for healthcare, and not getting treatment could have dire consequences. In my recent experience, being in the queue for nearly an hour before being told we would not get to see the doctor was frustrating. Many Singaporeans, like myself, have employee benefits at polyclinics that can help defray the cost of healthcare. Even with the Community Health Assist Scheme benefit, private healthcare costs are still higher than those for public healthcare. Policies on public healthcare accessibility at polyclinics should be reviewed to ensure that everyone can receive timely and appropriate care.

It seems that despite the public-private-Government experience in the management of Covid-19 over the past three years, much is to be desired in patients\u2019 health-seeking behaviour. Patients with simple ailments do not need to head to a polyclinic or a hospital accident and emergency department. A general practitioner can manage simple ailments and more. Employers and their human resource departments should not make use of the public healthcare system for employee healthcare benefits because in doing so, public money will be used for corporate healthcare, which is not how taxpayer money should be spent. The work load from this group of patients will add to the strain that doctors and healthcare staff in hospitals and polyclinics face. This will result in patients who otherwise need care at these institutions being deprived of the level of care they need. The public also needs to place more trust in the processes of our healthcare institutions. These are usually implemented with good reasons. A clinical triage and initial assessment done by a health professional like a nurse helps in the allocation of limited healthcare resources in an institution. This follows the basic principle of allowing the more ill and infirm to seek help first. Patients who visit any health institution should not go with the expectation that they will be seen immediately, but that they will be advised to follow instructions at the institution. With more mutual cooperation, trust and understanding, our healthcare institutions will be able to carry out their duties properly. Jeremy Chan Zi Ping (Dr)",2023-03-17T11:37:57,medical resources

Students to enter secondary school via posting groups mapped from current streams; form classes will be mixed A common Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate exam will replace the O-Levels and N-Levels from 2027. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: Starting from the 2024 Secondary 1 batch, all students will be posted into secondary schools in three groups, mapped from the existing score ranges for the Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams. The three posting groups will be used to facilitate school admission and guide the subject levels students offer at the start of the year, said the Ministry of Education (MOE). \u201cBeyond that, posting groups will not shape the secondary school experience,\u201d said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing in his speech during the Committee of Supply debates on Wednesday (Mar 1). This ensures that schools continue to admit students with diverse strengths, and students continue to have access to a wide range of schools, he added. \u201cBy admitting students from different posting groups, schools can also enable diversity at the class level, with mixed form classes that comprise students offering subjects at different subject levels,\u201d said Mr Chan. In schools that take in students from multiple posting groups, mixed form classes mean each class will be made up of students from different posting groups, taking subjects at different levels. With full subject-based banding implemented across 120 schools from next year, students in Secondary 1 in 2024 will sit for a common Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) exam, regardless of their initial posting group. The SEC will eventually replace the current O-Level and N-Level certificates from 2027, which current students sit for at the end of four or five years in secondary school. The option of spending a fifth year in secondary school will remain available to students who want to take subjects at a more demanding level, said Mr Chan. About 80 per cent of secondary schools will implement full subject-based banding, said MOE. The remaining schools include integrated programme schools such as Raffles Institution, which only accept students from posting group 3 \u2013 currently the Express stream. Crest Secondary School will also remain a specialised school that offers a customised curriculum for students in posting group 1 \u2013 currently the Normal (Technical) stream. However, these schools can still allow students to take subjects at a more demanding or less demanding level, said MOE. Currently, students can already take English, mathematics, science and mother tongue at a higher level in Secondary 1 if they did well in the subjects at the PSLE. This option will be expanded to humanities subjects at Secondary 2 from 2024. Previously, without mixed form classes and full subject-based banding, a school that accepted students from all three streams would typically see classes made up of only Express students, N(A) students or N(T) students. These students would also only take subjects at the level of their stream and then take the corresponding O-Level or N-Level examinations. But with the removal of streams and the start of full subject-based banding from 2024, students will have classmates from different posting groups. With full subject-based banding, students can now take subjects at a G3, G2 or G1 level, mapped from the current Express, N(A) and N(T) standards. A student who enters a school under posting group 3 will start off with mostly G3 subjects. A student who enters under posting group 2 will start off with mostly G2 subjects, but may be offered the option to take some at a G3 level depending on their PSLE results or if they do well later on. Students will take core subjects like science, mathematics or English in classes according to their subject level, which means a subject class could be made up of students from posting groups 2 and 3, with all of them taking the subject at a G3 level. In lower secondary, they will take six common curriculum subjects in their mixed form classes - art, design and technology, food and consumer education, music, physical education and character and citizenship education. HOW WILL THE POSTING GROUPS WORK?\u200b After students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), their results will reflect whether they are in posting group 3, 2 or 1. Students who score between 4 and 20 points will be in posting group 3, and those who score between 23 and 24 points will be in posting group 2, said MOE. Those who score 26 to 30 points, with an Achievement Level of 7 in English and mathematics, will be in posting group 1. Students who score 21 or 22 points will be put in an option band, and can choose to apply as a student from posting group 2 or 3. Students who score 25 points can choose between applying under posting group 1 or 2, the Education Ministry said. Currently, students who score within these option bands can already choose to apply for schools at an Express or N(A) level, and N(A) or N(T) level respectively. Each school will continue to have a different cut-off point range for each posting group it accepts. For example, a student in the first option band may apply to Crescent Girls\u2019 School, which will accept students from posting groups 2 and 3 from 2024. They can choose to apply under posting group 2 or 3. This student may then go on to enter the school under posting group 2, and eventually take some subjects at a G3 level. Under full subject-based banding, students can also choose to take subjects at a less demanding level if they are not coping well, said MOE. From 2026, some of these subjects will also be offered electives at more demanding or less demanding levels. This is to encourage students to take subjects based on their interests, said MOE. For example, computer applications is currently a standalone subject for lower secondary N(T) students. This will be discontinued, and computing will be offered as an elective subject for all upper secondary students from 2026, when the Secondary 1 batch of 2024 reaches Secondary 3. From the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort, social studies for the N(T) stream will also be discontinued, and replaced by G1 humanities, which is non-examinable. Most of the elective subjects taken at the upper secondary level are examinable, and there are some elective subjects, like History, that are not offered at the G1 level, said MOE. POST-SECONDARY PATHWAYS\u200b With students offering a more diverse combination of subjects because of full subject-based banding, MOE will adjust the admissions criteria for post-secondary school pathways, said Second Minister for Education Maliki Osman. \u201cThe range of post-secondary pathways that students could be eligible for will no longer be limited by streams but by their performance at different subject levels. Let me elaborate on these changes,\u201d he added. The intake for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme will be expanded to students taking G3 subjects or a mix of G3 and G2 subjects from 2028. This will increase the number of students accepted each year to 2,600 from 1,700, announced Dr Maliki. The Polytechnic Foundation Programme currently takes in Secondary 4 N(A) students who have taken the N-Level examinations. The programme prepares them to progress into selected polytechnic diploma courses, and serves as an alternative to a fifth year in secondary school. From the 2026 intake, students will be admitted to the programme in three broad clusters - sciences, design, engineering and technology, as well as humanities, art, media and business, said MOE. They will be posted to a specific diploma course after the programme, said Dr Maliki. MOE is also reviewing the polytechnic Year 1 admission criteria to better recognise the different subject levels taken by students, said he added. \u201cFor example, today, students have to take five G3 subjects to be eligible for polytechnic Year 1. With full subject-based banding, some may take subjects at the G2 level, and we are exploring allowing one G2 subject to be considered for admission,\u201d said Dr Maliki. The existing JC admission criteria \u201cremains relevant\u201d and will be retained, said the Education Ministry. The Institutes of Technical Education will also continue to expand Work-Study Diploma spots from 1,000 to 1,500 and Technical Diploma spots from 100 to 300 in 2025, MOE said.",2023-03-01T13:21:59,middle class

The CPF Board on Wednesday (Mar 8) noted that most of these accounts have low balances, with more than two-thirds of the accounts holding less than S$5,000 each. Owners of these accounts have received contributions from employers, or made voluntary contributions before 2003. They also include former Singapore citizens and permanent residents who have since relinquished their citizenship or permanent residency status. Account owners will have up until Mar 31, 2024, to transfer their CPF savings to their personal bank accounts. Remaining savings can still be transferred at any time after the accounts\u2019 automatic closures on Apr 1, 2024, but will cease to earn the prevailing CPF interest rate. Non-Singapore citizen/permanent resident employees who wish to continue saving in Singapore may consider options such as the Supplementary Retirement Scheme, or other relevant commercial investment products, said the CPF Board. The automatic closure of CPF accounts for all non-Singapore citizens and permanent residents in 2024 comes as the \u201cfinal step in ensuring that the CPF system focuses on its core objective of catering to the retirement, housing and healthcare needs of (existing) Singapore citizens and permanent residents\u201d, said the CPF Board. \u201cThe purpose of the CPF system is to help Singapore citizens and permanent residents retire with a peace of mind. In line with this, CPF members who are not Singapore citizens and permanent residents will have to close their CPF accounts.\u201d Prior to 1987, CPF contributions were mandatory for all employees working in Singapore \u2013 including those who did not have Singapore citizen and permanent resident status. The requirement was dropped in 1987, but non-Singapore citizen/permanent resident employees working in Singapore on work permits could opt to contribute to their CPF accounts on a voluntary basis. This was extended to non-Singapore citizen/permanent resident employees working in Singapore on all types of work passes, and not just work permit holders, from 1995. Non-Singapore citizen/permanent resident employees were disallowed from making voluntary contributions to their CPF accounts from 2003. Previously, the CPF Board told The Business Times that Singapore citizens and permanent residents renouncing their citizenship or residency statuses were \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to close their CPF accounts, as these members had no intention of retiring in Singapore.",2023-03-08T12:29:00,central provident fund

But former engineer Clement Ng Cheng Chuan decided to make a career switch at that age and become a nurse. Having just been retrenched after spending more than 30 years in the oil and gas industry, Mr Ng felt he was not ready to retire. The father of three adult children wanted to do something meaningful. Eventually, he enrolled in a two-year professional conversion programme (PCP) for registered nurses in 2017 and started studying for a nursing diploma. ""I wanted to keep learning and help others, especially the elderly,"" said the now 63-year-old, who works as a staff nurse caring for the elderly at St Luke's Hospital in Bukit Batok. ""I felt that I still had more to contribute and it is better to do something rather than sit at home."" Mr Ng now spends his time ensuring patients receive the right medication, looking after their well-being and following up on doctors' orders. ""It can be quite busy. We cannot predict what could happen next, so we need to react to situations fast,"" he shared. His interest in a nursing career started after a three-month stint as a healthcare assistant at a public hospital in 2017. He later decided to pursue a PCP for registered nurses, where he studied topics such as the human anatomy and picked up lifesaving skills such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillation procedures. His family was concerned he might not be able to cope with the work at his age, but he managed to convince them not to worry. ""They supported my decision and encouraged me,"" said Mr Ng, who hopes to work for as long as he is able to. He noted that age is not a barrier for those who want to take up a career in the healthcare sector. ""It is rewarding when the families appreciate what we have done for their loved ones,"" he added. https://www.straitstimes.com/singap...rough-professional-conversion-programme-at-60",2020-12-10T19:06:33,professional conversion programme

The latest figure, announced Friday, is lower than Singapore's previous low of 1.1 set in 2020 and lower than Japan's 2021 level. The resident total fertility rate refers to the average number of live births a woman has during her reproductive years. Indranee Rajah, who serves as minister in the Prime Minister's Office, told a parliamentary committee that the falling fertility rate was because of people marrying later and parents caring for older family members at the same time as children as the population grays. The decline also was partly due to the Year of the Tiger ""in the lunar calendar, which is generally associated with lower births among the Chinese,"" the minister said. But critics point to a high cost of living in the city state as a deeper cause. About 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing under the Housing & Development Board (HDB). Prices of these homes continue to rise, which contributes to couples waiting longer to marry and start a family. In this month's budget proposal, the government called for bigger cash payouts at birth, a doubling of parental leave for fathers and increased support for HDB home purchases. A total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered ""replacement level,"" which represents the average number of children a woman would need to have to reproduce herself by bearing a daughter who survives to childbearing age, according to the United Nations. Singapore is not the only Asian economy facing demographic headwinds. South Korea's total fertility rate fell to a new low of 0.78 last year, the lowest out of the 38 members of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Japan, which had a fertility rate of 1.3 in 2021, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government has vowed to increase the budget for child rearing support .",2023-02-26T11:05:13,meritocracy

Commentary: Full subject-based banding will only work if we stop categorising students Parents may worry if their children will be distracted by disruptive classmates when full subject-based banding and mixed form classes take effect. But this reaction is stereotyping at work, says June Yong. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: The full subject-based banding (SBB) system that will kick in nationwide for secondary school students in 2024 promises to usher in a new era of a strength-based approach to learning. Along with it, the old labels of Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) will no longer be used to build walls around groups of students. But the question is, will these walls remain in our minds? HOW FULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING WORKS\u200b Students entering secondary schools next year will no longer be sorted into Express and Normal streams. Instead, each student will take most subjects at either the G3, G2 or G1 level, which is mapped from today\u2019s Express, N(A) and N(T) standards, depending on their performance in the subject. Form classes are expected to have roughly equal proportions of G3 students and G1 or G2 students, depending on the school\u2019s makeup. They will take certain subjects together with their form class, such as PE, Art and character and citizenship education. But when it comes to mathematics, science and languages, the students will be split according to the subject level they are taking. I admit that my own first reaction to SBB was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be mayhem to lump the different students together in one class? How would the teachers teach?\u201d I had to call myself out for automatically assuming that the students who would take most of their subjects at the G1 or G2 levels would be the naughtier ones. Mr Tan, a teacher whose school has been piloting SBB for the past three years, shared that very often when teachers walk into a new class, they cannot tell the difference between the students in the Express stream and those in the Normal streams. Over time, certain differences may emerge - for example, Express-stream students may be more concerned about their academic performance, while their N(A) and N(T) counterparts may be less interested in their studies or may not follow instructions as readily, he described. But he added a caveat that this could also be stereotyping at work, admitting that both groups of students are more similar than we think. For example, he once met a student who was very well behaved and polite, and later found out that this student was from the N(T) stream. Such experiences have helped him realise that these categories really do not matter. THE BEAUTY OF SUBJECT-BASED BANDING\u200b When it comes to understanding the whys behind this new system, no one can fault its aim to remove the stigma of unhelpful labels that have resulted in a division between \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d at such a formative age. SBB treats every student as an individual, and seeks to maximise each person\u2019s potential. At the same time, I have heard many parents voice their worry about whether their children will end up being inadvertently taxed in this new system. One common concern is that they may end up being distracted by their naughtier classmates. But is this phenomenon of having disruptive classmates new? Would it be caused solely by the SBB system itself? That we seem to fall back on the trope that lower-ability students behave poorly may be reflective of how sticky the old labels are and how much persistence is required to scrub them off. To prod us along, we may need to revisit the benefits of heterogeneous classrooms. Diversity in a mixed classroom allows students to learn from one another\u2019s differences. In such a setting, there is also the potential for role modelling to take place, as weaker students learn from positive behaviours in class. According to Mr Tan\u2019s observations of his mixed form classes, the children actually get along with one other. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long for the students themselves to realise that different people have different gifts. Whereas in the old system, they\u2019re always made to believe that the one is better, and the other, worse.\u201d \u201cIf they can co-exist in this space, it will help them later on when they enter the workplace. They can hang out with anyone,\u201d he said. RISING TO THE CHALLENGE OF MIXED FORM CLASSES\u200b But friendships aside, it will remain to be seen as to whether the classroom setting will truly be more egalitarian and stigma-free. And this is where the skill level of educators comes in. In one research study, Stanford University researchers Elizabeth Cohen and Rachel Lotan hypothesised that teachers could affect students\u2019 perceptions of status in a heterogeneous classroom by altering the expectations of competence that students hold for themselves and for one another. They proposed two interventions: The multiple ability intervention and assigning competence to low-status students. The former entails discussing the many different intellectual abilities required by collective tasks, such as reasoning or problem-solving. The latter involves the teacher, after having observed instances of low-status students performing well on abilities relevant to the task, providing the student with specific, positive and public evaluations. The researchers found that the interventions were effective in promoting equal-status behaviour in the classroom, and clocked significant gains in participation and achievement of low-status students. This study shows that the role of the educator is particularly important in ensuring that classrooms are safe and effective learning spaces for all. While there may no longer be different streams, teachers are the first ones who have to fully embrace SBB and take intentional steps to ensure that lower-ability learners in their form classes are valued for their strengths. And because it might be more difficult to engage everyone equally, it may also mean that form teachers will need to give themselves time to understand their students better and to adjust their teaching methods accordingly. HELPING EVERY STUDENT FIND THEIR PLACE\u200b In the new system, everyone has a part to play. \u201cBeing a form teacher of a mixed class has made me realise that many of the kids are talented in different areas,\u201d explained Mr Tan. \u201cSome of the lower-ability students have very strong leadership traits. Some of them are showmen who are not afraid of going on stage and expressing themselves. They end up being the cheerleaders in class.\u201d While it is easy to reach for labels to help explain the different behaviours we may come across in class, it may be even better to focus on each student as an individual with different strengths, weaknesses and needs. \u201cIt has also made me realise that categorising them is really my problem. We need to shift gears and help them find the thing they\u2019re good at,\u201d he added. June Yong is the Lead of Insights at Focus on the Family Singapore.",2023-03-08T08:18:46,education subsidies

I've helped her gone through the benefits but am confused coz according to the Standard Plan, the surgery benefits have increased but the 90 days pre-post hospitalization benefits have ceased. Also, for example, dialysis treatment has increased to $2750 per mth for standard plan compared to $2500 for Plan B but the drugs claim for dialysis has also been reduced from $600 per month (plan B) to $450 per month (standard plan). These are just some examples I've provided. Has anyone converted from Plan B to Standard Plan and is it advisable to do so? Hope to hear from you guys! Thanks!",2016-07-18T03:23:32,MediShield Life

Commentary: Singapore residents must save for retirement today to continue enjoying low income taxes For direct taxes to remain low, Singapore workers need to do more with their money to prepare for their future retirement, says David Kuo of The Smart Investor. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: The message from the Budget 2023 speech could not have been clearer. It cannot be business as usual for Singapore. Over the last couple of decades, the country has benefited from global trade and finance flows. But with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, Singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. As the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. By 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. Budget 2023 offers targeted support to Singapore\u2019s growing pool of seniors . The ElderCare fund will be topped up by S$500 million, and another S$1.5 billion will be added to the MediFund. But just think about that for a moment. Singapore expects a Budget deficit of S$2 billion in the financial year (FY) of 2022, and a deficit of S$400 million in FY2023. Those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. That is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. If we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won\u2019t need government subsidies. ENSURING OUR RETIREMENT ADEQUACY\u200b As Singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that Singapore workers can do for themselves now. While the Government has kept the rate of contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from S$6,000 to S$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . But this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. If so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. Perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. This number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. A 2019 Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in Singapore is about S$1,400 a month. But considering that the median income per household member in Singapore is about S$3,200 a month, which adds up to S$38,400 per year, let\u2019s work off a round figure of S$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. You can scale this up or down accordingly, but don\u2019t forget to factor in inflation. At an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our S$50,000 target would be equivalent to S$100,000 in around 24 years\u2019 time. And in 48 years\u2019 time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. That, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. That is the income we would need to generate from our savings. Because we don\u2019t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. Taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the CPF Special Account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of S$100,000 a year in 24 years\u2019 time is S$2.5 million. We should ask ourselves if our accumulated CPF contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. If it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. That generally means investing in shares. There is a limit as to how much our CPF money can be invested in the stock market. So, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of CPF. The best time to do that is while we are young. INDIRECT TAXES PREVAIL OVER DIRECT TAXES\u200b Budget 2023 also highlighted the Government\u2019s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. Stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. So too will taxes on luxury cars . We can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. In the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. In the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. However, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. The upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the Government to redistribute wealth. After all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. It is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. SETTING ASIDE MONEY FOR THE NEXT CRISIS\u200b There was another important message in the Budget. While the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. Though Singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year\u2019s Budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. What\u2019s more, Singapore must continue to consciously build up its reserves to prepare for the next crisis. We need to do the same too. The Government has provided Singaporeans with the means to cope with inflationary pressures through voucher schemes . This should help ease some of the pain when we do our daily shopping. More importantly, it buys us time to set aside some money for a rainy day because wages are rising but income tax rates aren\u2019t. It is a window of opportunity that other developed economies have been unable to provide. But we need to fix our roofs when the sun is shining. It will be too late when thunderstorms hit. In summary, Budget 2023 puts households firmly in the driving seat. The Government is treating people as mature adults in a maturing economy. The country\u2019s finances are strong and should be even stronger over time. We too can make our household finances stronger over time by being prudent with our spending and preparing for future uncertainties. If we want our taxes to remain low, we need to do our part to ensure that it stays that way. David Kuo is Co-founder of The Smart Investor.",2023-02-23T09:09:32,low income

The enhanced programme aims to skill-up those who are keen to take up job roles such as port operations manager, shipping analyst, assistant technical superintendent and ship agent. Speaking at the Maritime Singapore Connect (MSC) Maritime Digital Challenge grand finals event on Saturday, Mr Chee said there are job opportunities in the maritime sector for mid-career individuals who bring ""useful skills and knowledge from other industries"". ""(The expanded programme) will equip mid-career switchers and existing maritime employees who are taking on different roles with new competencies in areas such as automation, data analytics, decarbonisation, and cybersecurity,"" said Mr Chee. The enhanced Career Conversion Programme for Sea Transport Professionals and Associates is rolled out by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). It comes on the back of a previous programme for Sea Transport Professionals and for Port Professionals, which benefited over 160 individuals in the past three years. The enhanced programme includes a new job redesign and reskilling pathway, a specialist maritime superintendency track, and an expansion to includesea transport associates, said WSG and MPA in a joint release on Saturday. To build up a local talent pipeline of maritime superintendents, WSG and MPA will pilot 20 placements under the new specialisation track. Such officers oversees ships' compliance with regulatory requirements and are in charge of ground-level crew management, while assistant technical superintendents manage ships' including ship's expenditures and ensure their seaworthiness. Individuals on this track will be awarded a specialist diploma in maritime superintendency by Singapore Polytechnic after they complete six modules and on-the-job training. Hiring outlook for the maritime sector remains positive despite Covid-19, with job postings in the MyCareersFuture portal up from 1,300 listings in January this year to about 1,770 listings in September, noted WSG and MPA. Among those who made a successful career switch is Mr Fok Jin Jin, a 39 -year-old senior LNG bunkering technician at FueLNG, a company that provides liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunker, highlighted by Mr Chee in his speech. Mr Fok was formerly an operation technician at a petroleum company and had no previous experience in handling LNG, but wanted to make a switch as he believes LNG is a growing sector with ample career opportunities. He participated in the Career Conversion Programme for Sea Transport Professionals November 2019. ""Due to the structured process and on-job training provided, I found the learning curve acceptable,"" said Mr Fok.",2021-11-13T18:21:05,professional conversion programme

A property-related tax would be easiest to implement and enforce, experts said, noting that any form of wealth tax, if implemented, should not result in excessive compliance costs for taxpayers. Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah told Parliament last November that the question is not whether Singapore wants to tax wealth, but how it can be done effectively so that such taxes cannot be easily avoided. She was responding to a motion filed by Workers' Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC), in which he proposed imposing a wealth tax of 0.5 per cent to 2 per cent on the wealthiest residents here. Such a tax could help diversify Singapore's revenue sources and reduce income and wealth inequality, he said. DBS Bank senior economist Irvin Seah wrote in a research note that while some form of a wealth tax increase, such as the reintroduction of estate duties, is likely, the shape and form remains uncertain, especially given the recent round of property cooling measures last December. ""Importantly, any decision in this regard would have to consider the risks of wealthy individuals redirecting their assets abroad,"" he noted. Mr David Sandison, head of tax at Grant Thornton Singapore, said that real estate-based taxes are the ""lowest hanging fruit"", as they are easy to collect and legislate. Grant Thornton has proposed several real estate taxes, including raising the property tax further for unoccupied residential property owned by non-residents and a capital gains tax on transactions in residential property with an exclusion for a principal private residence. Ms Shantini Ramachandra, Southeast Asia tax leader for Deloitte Private, said that wealth taxes could take the form of a recalibration of property tax rates or buyer's stamp duty rates for higher-value residential properties. Like Mr Sandison, she also said another option could be a capital gains tax on the sale of luxury residential properties. ""The introduction of a new wealth tax that is solely targeted at the private assets of the wealthy, or the introduction of inheritance or gift taxes, would be counter-intuitive to the efforts that the Singapore government has put in place to develop Singapore into a premier hub for wealth management and to attract foreign investors to invest, work and live in Singapore,"" she said.",2022-02-12T11:58:08,wealth tax

While wages have generally increased over time, the rise in housing prices has outpaced wage growth in recent years. According to data from the Department of Statistics Singapore, median monthly income from work has increased steadily over the past decade. From 2010 to 2020, the median monthly income for full-time employed residents rose from SGD 3,427 to SGD 4,534, an increase of about 32%. However, during this same period, the price of housing in Singapore also increased significantly.  According to data from the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the resale price index for HDB flats increased by about 46% from 2010 to 2020. This means that while wages in Singapore have generally increased, they have not kept pace with the rise in housing prices. This has made it increasingly difficult for many Singaporeans to afford a home, especially younger generations who are just starting their careers. The Singapore government has implemented various policies over the years to address this issue, including increasing the supply of public housing and introducing measures to cool down the private housing market. However, the issue of affordable housing remains a concern for many Singaporeans. By the way, the above answer has not taken into account the crazy housing price increase in the past 2 years (2021-2022).

In February, I was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. With affirmation from my financial adviser, I pursued treatment at a private practice. I began treatment and submitted my claims for my critical illness payout as well as my upgraded hospital plan's coverage. This hospitalisation coverage entitled me to claim 100 per cent of my pre-hospitalisation bills on top of the full sum assured from the life protection policy. Throughout, I held on to the assurance that my policy would ease my burdens, as my income was affected by my sickness. Five months later, the insurer rejected these claims, citing failure in disclosing my vertigo and asthma. These ailments occurred one or two years before I bought the policy, during separate one-time visits to the family clinic for dizziness and cough. I was not formally diagnosed, and I did not think these were conditions worth disclosing as there were no specialist referrals and the clinics deemed further examinations unnecessary. Hence, the insurer's reasoning baffled me. How could these two incidents alter my outcome? The insurer also took five months to process my claims instead of one to three months. I asked other insurers, who said such claims should take only up to a month to help clients in times of urgent need. I was left stranded with a whopping $100,000 in medical bills with an additional $150,000 potentially pending. After speaking to others, I realised there were many others who have fallen between the cracks and were denied adequate care by their insurer.

A local survey published last month found that the median gross monthly salary of last year's graduates had shot up from S$3,800 in 2021 to S$4,200 (US$2,860 to US$3,160). This was a sharp spike compared with previous years, where median salaries for fresh graduates typically increased by S$100 each year. One mechanical engineering graduate, who took up an operations role in the automotive industry, told CNA that his starting pay was S$3,500 \u2013 well below last year's median salary of S$4,600 for those in the engineering cluster. The 26-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Lewis, graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in May last year. His current job was one of three offers he received within a month of applying for jobs after graduating in May last year. The other two had offered a slightly higher pay of S$3,600 but he eventually settled for his current role due to the company\u2019s reputation and the prospect of receiving bonus payouts of up to six months. Based on his knowledge of the company's typical salary increments, he estimated that his salary would increase by about 5 per cent following his performance appraisal. While this will bump his salary up to S$3,675, it would still be lower than last year\u2019s median pay for his sector. \u201cI do feel a bit left out,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut at this juncture of my career, I\u2019m still very much learning and so my focus isn\u2019t really about how much I\u2019m making, but rather the exposure and experience I\u2019m getting."" Another fresh graduate, who received his degree in information systems from the National University of Singapore (NUS) last May, was offered S$5,200 for a software developer role. The 27-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Keith, successfully negotiated a higher pay of S$5,500. Despite this, his salary is still lower than the median starting pay of S$5,625 for those in the information and digital technologies cluster. But not all graduates from the Class of 2022 have managed to land a job. Another NUS graduate, who received her degree in psychology with a minor in communications and new media in December, is still unemployed and on the search for a full-time job. The 24-year-old, who wanted to be known as Eunice, told CNA she applied for 60 to 70 jobs in various industries since the start of the year but few have responded. \u201cI\u2019m casting my net wide and applying for roles that seem interesting to me, so I have been looking at entry-level and associate roles that suit my skills or are in companies that I really like,\u201d she said.

As part of the Government's pandemic response, COVID-19 treatments were p www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: As Singapore progressively returns to normal and the population learns to live with COVID-19, related coronavirus treatment financing schemes will be updated, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Jun 10). As part of the Government's pandemic response, COVID-19 treatments were provided ""at a very low fee or free of charge"", said MOH in a multi-ministerial task force press release. This was beyond existing healthcare support in the form of Government Subsidies, MediSave, MediShield Life and MediFund (S+3Ms). ""As life reverts to normal and we increasingly live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, we will need to progressively scale back the pandemic subsidy policy, and revert to the S+3Ms healthcare financing frameworks,"" said the ministry. PHPC, POLYCLINIC SUBSIDIES\u200b Since February 2020, more than 1,000 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) have been activated to provide subsidised care for patients with respiratory infection symptoms, whether due to COVID-19 or not. Singapore residents pay a flat subsidised rate of S$10 while Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors are charged a lower rate of S$5. From Jul 1, subsidies at PHPCs and polyclinics for the treatment of respiratory infections will revert to pre-COVID-19 levels. The subsidised fees will no longer apply, but Singaporeans will continue to receive prevailing subsidies under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) at CHAS general practitioner (GP) clinics. This does not affect antigen rapid tests (ARTs) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. PHPCs and polyclinics will continue to provide government-funded swabs to eligible symptomatic individuals at no charge, said MOH. TELEMEDICINE FOR PROTOCOL 2 INDIVIDUALS\u200b Currently, Protocol 2 cases who request telemedicine care enjoy full subsidies. Protocol 2 cases are those who are mildly symptomatic, low risk, and recovering from COVID-19 at home . MOH said it will revert the subsidy policy to pre-COVID-19 arrangements from Jul 1. Full subsidy for telemedicine will cease, but Singaporeans will continue receiving CHAS subsidies if they visit a CHAS GP clinic for treatment. Individuals under Protocol 1 - those at high medical risk or with severe symptoms, but are discharged home for recovery and under telemedicine surveillance - will continue to enjoy fully subsidised telemedicine care. TREATMENT COVERAGE IN HOSPITALS\u200b Singaporeans, permanent residents or long-term pass holders who seek emergency treatment for COVID-19 at emergency departments of public hospitals currently do not have to pay any emergency department charges. This is only for those who are fully vaccinated, or certified to be medically ineligible for vaccination. From Jul 1, this will no longer apply to those who do not require admission after visiting the emergency department. MOH said this move will help them manage the demand for such services. Those who are assessed to require hospital or COVID-19 treatment facility admission will continue to have their emergency department, inpatient and/or treatment facility bills fully subsidised by the government. Only those who are fully vaccinated or certified to be medically ineligible for vaccination are eligible for this subsidy. As part of ongoing COVID-19 surveillance, MOH said it will continue to monitor for virus strains introduced into and circulating in the community by requiring some infected individuals to take an additional government-funded PCR swab for genomic sequencing. ""Our daily caseloads have remained under control even with the significant easing of our community (safe management measures) and border measures. However, new variants will continue to emerge, and we must stay vigilant,"" said the Health Ministry.

Commentary: Full subject-based banding will only work if we stop categorising students Parents may worry if their children will be distracted by disruptive classmates when full subject-based banding and mixed form classes take effect. But this reaction is stereotyping at work, says June Yong. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: The full subject-based banding (SBB) system that will kick in nationwide for secondary school students in 2024 promises to usher in a new era of a strength-based approach to learning. Along with it, the old labels of Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) will no longer be used to build walls around groups of students. But the question is, will these walls remain in our minds? HOW FULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING WORKS\u200b Students entering secondary schools next year will no longer be sorted into Express and Normal streams. Instead, each student will take most subjects at either the G3, G2 or G1 level, which is mapped from today\u2019s Express, N(A) and N(T) standards, depending on their performance in the subject. Form classes are expected to have roughly equal proportions of G3 students and G1 or G2 students, depending on the school\u2019s makeup. They will take certain subjects together with their form class, such as PE, Art and character and citizenship education. But when it comes to mathematics, science and languages, the students will be split according to the subject level they are taking. I admit that my own first reaction to SBB was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be mayhem to lump the different students together in one class? How would the teachers teach?\u201d I had to call myself out for automatically assuming that the students who would take most of their subjects at the G1 or G2 levels would be the naughtier ones. Mr Tan, a teacher whose school has been piloting SBB for the past three years, shared that very often when teachers walk into a new class, they cannot tell the difference between the students in the Express stream and those in the Normal streams. Over time, certain differences may emerge - for example, Express-stream students may be more concerned about their academic performance, while their N(A) and N(T) counterparts may be less interested in their studies or may not follow instructions as readily, he described. But he added a caveat that this could also be stereotyping at work, admitting that both groups of students are more similar than we think. For example, he once met a student who was very well behaved and polite, and later found out that this student was from the N(T) stream. Such experiences have helped him realise that these categories really do not matter. THE BEAUTY OF SUBJECT-BASED BANDING\u200b When it comes to understanding the whys behind this new system, no one can fault its aim to remove the stigma of unhelpful labels that have resulted in a division between \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d at such a formative age. SBB treats every student as an individual, and seeks to maximise each person\u2019s potential. At the same time, I have heard many parents voice their worry about whether their children will end up being inadvertently taxed in this new system. One common concern is that they may end up being distracted by their naughtier classmates. But is this phenomenon of having disruptive classmates new? Would it be caused solely by the SBB system itself? That we seem to fall back on the trope that lower-ability students behave poorly may be reflective of how sticky the old labels are and how much persistence is required to scrub them off. To prod us along, we may need to revisit the benefits of heterogeneous classrooms. Diversity in a mixed classroom allows students to learn from one another\u2019s differences. In such a setting, there is also the potential for role modelling to take place, as weaker students learn from positive behaviours in class. According to Mr Tan\u2019s observations of his mixed form classes, the children actually get along with one other. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long for the students themselves to realise that different people have different gifts. Whereas in the old system, they\u2019re always made to believe that the one is better, and the other, worse.\u201d \u201cIf they can co-exist in this space, it will help them later on when they enter the workplace. They can hang out with anyone,\u201d he said. RISING TO THE CHALLENGE OF MIXED FORM CLASSES\u200b But friendships aside, it will remain to be seen as to whether the classroom setting will truly be more egalitarian and stigma-free. And this is where the skill level of educators comes in. In one research study, Stanford University researchers Elizabeth Cohen and Rachel Lotan hypothesised that teachers could affect students\u2019 perceptions of status in a heterogeneous classroom by altering the expectations of competence that students hold for themselves and for one another. They proposed two interventions: The multiple ability intervention and assigning competence to low-status students. The former entails discussing the many different intellectual abilities required by collective tasks, such as reasoning or problem-solving. The latter involves the teacher, after having observed instances of low-status students performing well on abilities relevant to the task, providing the student with specific, positive and public evaluations. The researchers found that the interventions were effective in promoting equal-status behaviour in the classroom, and clocked significant gains in participation and achievement of low-status students. This study shows that the role of the educator is particularly important in ensuring that classrooms are safe and effective learning spaces for all. While there may no longer be different streams, teachers are the first ones who have to fully embrace SBB and take intentional steps to ensure that lower-ability learners in their form classes are valued for their strengths. And because it might be more difficult to engage everyone equally, it may also mean that form teachers will need to give themselves time to understand their students better and to adjust their teaching methods accordingly. HELPING EVERY STUDENT FIND THEIR PLACE\u200b In the new system, everyone has a part to play. \u201cBeing a form teacher of a mixed class has made me realise that many of the kids are talented in different areas,\u201d explained Mr Tan. \u201cSome of the lower-ability students have very strong leadership traits. Some of them are showmen who are not afraid of going on stage and expressing themselves. They end up being the cheerleaders in class.\u201d While it is easy to reach for labels to help explain the different behaviours we may come across in class, it may be even better to focus on each student as an individual with different strengths, weaknesses and needs. \u201cIt has also made me realise that categorising them is really my problem. We need to shift gears and help them find the thing they\u2019re good at,\u201d he added. June Yong is the Lead of Insights at Focus on the Family Singapore.",2023-03-08T08:18:46,elite education

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - Researchers at the Duke-NUS Medical School have found that university students who have classes in the morning have worse grades than those who have fewer or no classes in the morning. The study looked at the scores of 33,818 students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) across six semesters between 2016 and 2019. The students were from all faculties except medicine, which has a different grading system. Students with only morning classes had lower grades than those with only afternoon classes, the study found. The researchers defined morning classes as any class that starts before noon. Associate Professor Joshua Gooley in the neuroscience and behavioural disorders programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, one of the co-authors of the study, said students who go from having no morning classes to having three or more morning classes may see their grades drop from an A- to a B+, or from a B+ to a B for a course. The Duke-NUS study also found that students with 8am classes are more likely to skip class and have less sleep than those with classes that start later. Researchers said the lack of sleep impairs one\u2019s attention and memory processes, which may prevent students from reaching their full learning potential in class. Singaporeans clocked only 6.6 hours of sleep on weekdays in 2020, with a final average score of 6.8 hours daily, down from 7 hours in 2019, according to the Philips 2021 global sleep survey. Fatigue and oversleeping are also commonly why university students skip classes, another factor for the poorer performance, according to the Duke-NUS study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour in February. Researchers found the attendance for 8am classes to be about 10 per cent lower than for all other classes that started later, according to the study. These insights were drawn using the Wi-Fi connection logs of 23,391 students to estimate students\u2019 lecture attendance rates as well as activity data from special sensing watches, which use a motion sensor to track whether the wearer is awake or asleep, of 181 students over six weeks. To determine if early morning classes were linked with students getting less sleep, the researchers also analysed activity data with the day and night patterns of digital learning platform logins of 39,458 students. The study stated that even though students frequently slept past the start of 8am classes, they still lost about an hour of sleep on average compared with days with only afternoon classes or no classes. There have been calls by MPs and experts in the past to start schools later, but usually for primary and secondary students. Prof Gooley said: \u201cThe take-home message from our study is that universities should reconsider mandatory early morning classes.\u201d He added that 10am would be a good time to start classes for most students and faculty members. \u201cThere are some students, such as night owls, who would still lose out on sleep if classes were pushed back to 10am, but most students would be able to sleep in longer and reach class on time,\u201d he said. Researchers are also now studying the differences between class attendance, sleep, well-being and academic performance between early birds and night owls.",2023-03-29T22:25:46,lower class

It has a margin of error of 3%. That sentiment is an indication of the challenges finance minister and prime minister in-waiting Lawrence Wong faces in convincing voters that the ruling People\u2019s Action Party is doing enough to tackle sharp price rises. Many governments and central banks are acting in tandem to shield their citizens from the cost-of-living crisis sweeping the world. \u201cA perfect storm has emerged post-pandemic that will test the Singaporean government over the next 12 months as it not only seeks to bring about a speedy recovery but also bed in new political leadership,\u201d said David Black, the founder and chief executive officer of Blackbox. Singapore\u2019s cost pressures have been persistent this year, prompting the central bank to tighten monetary policy and revise expectations for price-growth that could crimp the broader post-Covid growth recovery. While officials are hopeful that nominal wage growth will outpace inflation this year, economists see prices remaining elevated in the city-state through 2023. Global inflation, exacerbated by supply-side pressures caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has filtered through to consumers worldwide, even as early signs of inflation peaking appear. In an indication of the risks facing the city-state\u2019s economic recovery as it emerges from strict Covid restrictions, respondents said they have cut back on their spending due to inflation, with nearly nine in 10 spending less on clothing, restaurants, and entertainment at cinemas and theaters. Wong has committed to help residents to cope with consumption tax increases set to kick in initially next year in his maiden budget delivered in February. About 57% of low-income respondents -- earning below S$2,500 ($1,800) a month -- said the government was doing badly, while 59% of medium-low income households, earning S$,2500 to S$6,600, felt the same, the survey showed. Other key points from the poll include: Singaporeans are feeling the most inflation pain in petrol prices (35%), followed by utility prices (34%), and at supermarkets (28%) 66% of Singaporeans say they feel negatively about rising public housing prices Only 44% believe that they will be economically better off this year than 2021",2022-06-10T17:03:07,disposable income

They are: 1. Retirement Sum Scheme automatic transfers\u200b Now: After their Retirement Account is depleted, members will continue receiving payouts, only if they apply to transfer money in their Ordinary Account and Special Account to their Retirement Account. After: Members automatically continue to receive payouts from their Ordinary and Special Accounts savings when their Retirement Account savings are used up. This will benefit around 83,000 people under the Retirement Sum Scheme from the first quarter of 2022. For CPF Life members who have started getting payouts, Retirement Account inflows will automatically be used to increase their payouts as well, benefiting some 75,000 people. 2. Flexibility in deciding when to transfer funds\u200b Now: For members turning 65 from 2023, the transfer of Ordinary and Special Accounts savings to their Retirement Account will occur, up to their cohort's full retirement sum, once they are eligible to start payouts. From Jan 2023: Members have the flexibility to decide on when to transfer the funds, anytime between 65 and 70 years old. There is no change to current rules for lump sum withdrawal of CPF savings. 3. Simplifying tax relief rules\u200b Now: There is a $7,000 tax relief cap for the Retirement Sum Topping-Up scheme provided to givers. Separately, there is also a limit for tax relief for the Voluntary Contributions to MediSave Account scheme for the recipients, which depends on the CPF Annual Limit and the current Basic Healthcare Sum. From Jan 1, 2022: To align rules for both schemes, tax relief for the Voluntary Contributions to MediSave Account scheme will also be provided to givers, instead of recipients There will be a higher combined tax relief cap for both schemes set at $8,000. This means the cap is $8,000 for top-ups to self and $8,000 for top-ups to loved ones. 4. Quicker disbursement of CPF money after a member dies\u200b Now: CPF funds can continue to be retained with accrued interest up to seven years after a member dies. Discounted Singtel shares are also retained in the CPF accounts for up to seven years. From April 2022: The duration that CPF money is retained after death will be shortened to six months. Discounted Singtel shares will also be liquidated and automatically disbursed six weeks after the member's death. There is no change to the nominees' rights to make claims at any time. 5. Government to recover grants if eligibility criteria not met\u200b Now: The Government can already claw back grants made erroneously to ineligible people From Jan 1, 2022: This is just a technical update to the rules so the Government can recover grants in cases where the grants were automatically issued to eligible members, but the members later chose not to continue meeting the eligibility conditions.

The latest figure, announced Friday, is lower than Singapore's previous low of 1.1 set in 2020 and lower than Japan's 2021 level. The resident total fertility rate refers to the average number of live births a woman has during her reproductive years. Indranee Rajah, who serves as minister in the Prime Minister's Office, told a parliamentary committee that the falling fertility rate was because of people marrying later and parents caring for older family members at the same time as children as the population grays. The decline also was partly due to the Year of the Tiger ""in the lunar calendar, which is generally associated with lower births among the Chinese,"" the minister said. But critics point to a high cost of living in the city state as a deeper cause. About 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing under the Housing & Development Board (HDB). Prices of these homes continue to rise, which contributes to couples waiting longer to marry and start a family. In this month's budget proposal, the government called for bigger cash payouts at birth, a doubling of parental leave for fathers and increased support for HDB home purchases. A total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered ""replacement level,"" which represents the average number of children a woman would need to have to reproduce herself by bearing a daughter who survives to childbearing age, according to the United Nations. Singapore is not the only Asian economy facing demographic headwinds. South Korea's total fertility rate fell to a new low of 0.78 last year, the lowest out of the 38 members of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Japan, which had a fertility rate of 1.3 in 2021, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government has vowed to increase the budget for child rearing support .",2023-02-26T11:05:13,income inequality

One of them is Mr Nigel Leong, who at 48 years old is finally pursuing his first passion, nearly three decades after he was dissuaded by his parents from taking a degree in nursing. This year, the former regional quality manager at a multi-national company tendered his resignation and took a significant pay cut to join WSG's Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for Registered Nurses (Degree) in April. He turned down lucrative job offers from other companies, including one that would allow him to relocate to Switzerland, and decided to make the switch to nursing to contribute back to society. Mr Leong, who is single, is expected to graduate from the National University of Singapore's Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies in 2022 as a staff nurse working for SingHealth Community Hospitals (SCH). He is one of 18 participants of the PCP for Registered Nurses who have been sponsored by SCH. Of this group, six nurses have started work at the three community hospitals managed by SCH: Bright Vision Hospital, Sengkang Community Hospital and Outram Community Hospital. Mr Leong said his passion for healthcare started when he was a combat medic while serving his National Service. ""It prompted me to want to pursue a degree in nursing in Sydney, but unfortunately my parents were against it because of the stigma associated with nursing. In the 1990s, it was seen as a lowly job,"" he said. ""My father asked me why should he invest so much money for me to study in Sydney to 'clean people's backside',"" he added with a chuckle. Not wanting to go against his parent's wishes, he took up a degree in food science and has been in this industry for 23 years until he made the career switch. Ms Stephanie Yeap, director of nursing at SCH, said the working experience of mid-career individuals like Mr Leong provides them with a ""different outlook and perspective in their care delivery"", with skill sets that may complement their clinical skills. She added that mid-career nurses also tend to have a stronger passion and drive for nursing. ""These mid-career nurses are at the stage of life where they understand themselves better and know what sort of career would suit them best,"" said Ms Yeap. https://www.straitstimes.com/singap...switch-to-nursing-via-professional-conversion",2020-09-22T21:25:39,professional conversion programme

The impact of the Budget on the middle-income had come up during the Budget debate, with MPs from both sides of the aisle asking for more help for the sandwiched class who have to care for both young children and elderly parents. In response, Mr Wong cited figures to show that for households in the middle quintile, taking into account their total taxes paid \u2013 not just personal income tax, but other indirect taxes as well \u2013 the effective tax burden is around 10 per cent of income.

During the Budget debate on Wednesday, Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai said that middle-class Singaporeans are overtaxed relative to their income, as they pay a wide range of indirect taxes, such as the goods and services tax (GST) and the certificate of entitlement. \u201cI think the facts and figures speak for themselves,\u201d said Mr Wong. \u201cWhat Mr Leong said is an outright falsehood.\u201d Among advanced economies, Singapore is also one of the few economies in which people in the middle have enjoyed significant increases in real incomes in the last 20 years, said Mr Wong.",2023-02-24T20:44:17,middle income

The net result is that locals can take on the jobs at \u201cslightly higher levels\u201d , Dr Tan said, citing findings from internal studies by his ministry on foreign workforce policies. \u201cThis has therefore informed our approach of remaining open to high quality foreign professionals while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of Work Permit holders through quotas and also levies,\u201d he said. However, there is a limit to how much the government can tighten access to lower-skilled foreign workers, due to the size of Singapore\u2019s population, Dr Tan pointed out. Continuing to do so would have a \u201cworse-off\u201d effect on Singapore\u2019s economic progress and industry development, he added. Noting that the same correlation of tightening foreign worker access and improving local employment does not apply at higher skill levels, Perera asked if this meant that Singapore is not producing enough highly skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating. Disagreeing, Dr Tan said: \u201cWe are already doing significantly more to improve on the prospects in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, in the upskilling, in upgrading.\u201d But accelerating changes have forced economies and industries to evolve rapidly, alongside other significant disruptions, he said. \u201cTo keep pace with those and to keep ahead pre-emptively, in terms of making sure that we\u2019re ahead of the competition, we will not just need to develop our own local talent, we will also need foreign workers to come alongside with us and complement us as we move forward.\u201d Dr Tan noted however that the studies \u201care but just one input to the entire policymaking process\u201d, adding that they have their limitations. \u201cFor example, they are unable to account for less quantifiable effects of having foreigners in our workplace and our workforce, such as the knowledge spillovers to locals and other network effects,\u201d he said. This means the impact of the interventions studied might also change if they are applied beyond a certain scale or at a different time period. The studies need to be interpreted carefully with other sources of information, including more recent labour market statistics and industry feedback, he said. https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/si...rkers-more-likely-improve-job-outcomes-locals",2023-02-27T13:29:15,occupation mobility

The research found that a family of four, with parents, a pre-teen and a teenager, needs at least $6,426 a month for a basic standard of living. A family of two, with a single parent and a toddler or pre-schooler, needs $3,218 a month. The median household income from work per household member is $2,463, according to the Census report released in June. Going by the data from the minimum income standards report, many more Singapore families would not be able to survive on their income. There are some household items budgeted for in the report that may not be representative of a normal household ( MOF flags issues with report, Oct 9 ). Household durable goods like refrigerators, air-conditioners, washing machines, televisions and sofas can last a couple of years at least. Having one-to-one private tuition will cost more than group tuition. It is also not necessary to take up tuition for every subject. For items like newspapers and books, these can be read or viewed online and do not cost much. Many websites offer free and up-to-date news. Mortgage payments for housing should not be considered an expenditure. It is an asset which can be realised if sold in future. There are many government transfers or subsidies given to lower-income families. In the Key Household Income Trends 2020 report issued by the Department of Statistics Singapore, resident households received $6,308 per household member on average from various government schemes last year. Resident households staying in Housing Board one- and two-room flats received $13,670 per household member. The transfer may come in the form of a medical subsidy like the Chas (Community Health Assist Scheme) card, which subsidises low-income patients with selected chronic conditions up to $320 per year. Last year, 30,000 low-income households were given a $50 Public Transport Voucher per household. I understand that many government transfers or subsidies may not be given out forever. Families must make rational choices with their expenditure. Always choose to spend within your means and you will have enough to lead a comfortable life.

The price of coffee in all the coffeeshop around Marsiling MRT area has risen collectively and now a single cup of Kopi-C is S$1.50 cents. 2.  For many residents with a fixed amount of money for their meals per day. Many may have to forgo their daily luxury which is just a simple cup of coffee or tea. Some couples may share but this is not practical for many others. 3. I noticed that previously some coffee shop have different cup sizes at different prices but alas, this is not available in our Marsiling estate. 4. Perhaps you can go around and convince the various coffee shops to provide smaller cup at relatively cheaper prices.  For example, the standard price of Kopi-C is S$1.50  and which if with the re-introduction of smaller cup, can price at maybe 80 cents. 5. 80 cents would be more affordable to those who had to forgo due to the price hike. 6. The coffee shop may even stands to earn more with more returning customers. 7. Thus pricing strategy is very important to allow residents to have access to basic commodities besides the government handouts. Often price hikes suffer a vicious cycle with declining customers which in turn spur greater prices increase. 8. Hope you can do this math and take initiatives to start in Marsiling and perhaps introduce it to other estates too. Regards, Mikey",2023-03-10T10:45:49,disposable income

This new requirement, which also applies to domestic helpers, is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses as medical costs rise, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday, highlighting that more than 5 per cent of foreign workers\u2019 medical bills exceed the current $15,000 coverage limit. An average of more than 1,000 employers a year face this issue, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament in March 2022, when he announced the move for additional insurance coverage. MOM estimates that more than 99 per cent of bills for hospitalisation and surgical procedures will fall within the new coverage limit. Under the new rules, employers also have to co-pay 25 per cent of claim amounts that go above the first $15,000. This means that if a worker incurs a $60,000 bill for heart surgery, for instance, the employer will have to pay $11,250, which is 25 per cent of $45,000. The insurer will cover the other $48,750. From July 2025, several other changes will also be implemented. Employers will no longer need to pay for their workers\u2019 medical treatment upfront and claim the amount from insurers later. Insurers will be required to reimburse hospitals directly. There will also be a standard list of allowable exclusions for insurers, such as procedures that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery. Insurers will not have to cover the treatments for pre-existing illnesses occurring within the first 12 months of work under the same employer. Insurers must also offer different premiums for workers aged 50 and below, and those above the age of 50, from July 2025. There were 1,033,500 work permit holders \u2013 of whom 268,500 were maids \u2013 and 177,900 S Pass holders working in Singapore as at the end of last year. Medical bills of migrant workers are not subsidised or covered under national schemes such as MediShield Life and MediFund. MOM said the policy changes are being implemented in phases to give employers and insurers time to adjust to the cost impact. The ministry added: \u201cWith many insurers expressing interest to offer the enhanced medical insurance products, the market will be competitive and employers will have a range of insurers to choose from.\u201d Employers must provide medical insurance coverage of at least $60,000 for maids, migrant workers from July This is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses, said MOM.

A local survey found that the median starting pay for fresh graduates increased by S$400 last year, which was four times higher compared to previous years. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: When a survey about the starting salaries of fresh graduates made the headlines in February, one 25-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Kathleen, was shocked by the findings. The 2022 Joint Autonomous Universities Graduate Employment Survey, which was conducted by four universities in Singapore, revealed that the median gross monthly salary of last year's graduates had shot up from S$3,800 in 2021 to S$4,200 . This was a sharp spike compared to previous years, where median salaries for fresh graduates typically increased by S$100 each year. Nearly all course clusters - except for the arts, media and design - saw an increase in starting salaries ranging between S$65 and S$700. The increase was the most significant in the engineering course cluster, which saw the median gross monthly salary of those in full-time jobs increase from S$3,900 in 2021 to S$4,600 last year. This would mean that someone starting a job in 2021 at the median salary point would have needed an 18 per cent pay increase to match 2022's level. For Kathleen, who has been working for nearly two years in a sustainability role in the private sector, this was a bitter pill to swallow. While she declined for the exact details of her salary to be published, the amount she shared with CNA was lower than the median starting pay of last year's fresh graduates, despite annual increments. ""It's very sad. When the report came out, my friends and I couldn't believe it,"" she said. ""We have been working for two years only to be on the same pay or even lower than a fresh graduate."" A friend of hers - who also graduated in 2021 and has about two years of experience in consultancy - had told her that her company recently hired a fresh graduate, who had a higher starting pay than her, said Kathleen. ""But she got an increment because he came in, if not, he was going to earn more than her. So she got lucky,"" she added. Kathleen isn't the only one whose salary is now lagging behind those with less experience than them. CNA spoke to three other people who graduated between 2019 and 2021, one of whom was also earning less than S$4,200. The 27-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Samuel, told CNA that he had recently been given a salary increment of S$300, after working full-time for six months in the public sector. This bumped his gross monthly salary to S$3,700, which was still below last year's median salary of S$3,800 for those in the humanities and social sciences cluster. ""It did surprise me a little bit that even with my increment, my salary is still lower than the median salary for fresh graduates last year,"" said the 27-year-old, who graduated in 2020 with a degree in Geography and also has a master's degree in urban planning. ""But I don't really have any strong views about it because I think there might be underlying caveats to the study as well,"" he said. ""So I don't think it affects my outlook on my current job or whether I should be asking for more salary."" The other two, who only wanted to be known as Stephanie and Megan, were both earning around S$5,000. Stephanie graduated in 2020 with an environmental degree and has been working for nearly two years in a finance role, while Megan - who graduated in 2019 with a degree in linguistics - has been with her current employer for about seven months, working in human resources (HR). But with rising costs increasingly eating into wages, some junior employees may feel like they have been low-balled. In January, Singapore's headline inflation inched up to 6.6 per cent year on year , from 6.5 per cent in the previous month, according to data published by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry last month. Core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport, rose to 5.5 per cent year on year, up from 5.1 per cent in December 2022. This was largely driven by higher inflation for services, food and retail and other goods, along with the increase in the goods and services tax (GST) rate. The authorities maintained their inflation outlook for this year, with headline inflation expected to average 5.5. to 6.5 per cent and core inflation, 3.5 to 4.5 per cent. ""My wage has increased but I feel like it's not increasing enough as compared to inflation,"" said Stephanie, adding that her starting pay was around S$4,000. ""Inflation and the GST are really taking a pinch on a lot of us and I'm feeling the impact of the rising costs for things like my daily necessities and transport."" ""I would be lying if I said I wasn't jealous of them because they graduated later than me and don't have as much experience as me, but they're earning more than I did when I first started,"" she admitted.",2023-03-30T08:31:36,less educated

When my landlord\u2019s family is home, I sleep, work and relax within the confines of my rented room, and plan my usage of the kitchen and common bathroom around their schedule. Online property portals advertise similar compact rooms at eye-watering rental rates, often with restrictions such as \u201cno cooking\u201d, \u201claundry only once a week\u201d, \u201cno guests\u201d and \u201cno Wi-Fi\u201d. Singapore\u2019s current public housing policy prioritises married couples and families, leaving little allowance for single adults under the age of 35 who yearn for a home of their own. The unspoken assumption is that singles are content to continue living under their parents\u2019 roof and under their parents\u2019 rules, and do not need any privacy or personal space. Yet for some, moving out may be the only way to escape an unbearable or abusive family situation. Others like myself simply crave the freedom to live our own lives as independent adults. Singles who choose to take the leap must be prepared to deplete their savings on monthly rental. They may have to resort to co-living to save costs, or scrimp and save to buy an overpriced shoebox condominium unit. Even after they finally turn 35, public housing options are limited to a two-room Build-To-Order flat \u2013 subject to income caps, and mostly located in non-mature estates \u2013 or a resale flat, which would be more costly. I commend the HDB for taking this step in providing more housing options for lower-income singles, and hope to see more creative solutions that will allow all single Singaporeans to have equal access to homes where we can grow and thrive.

Amid calls for spending, there were also calls for prudence, with some MPs wondering if Singapore would have enough fiscal room in future. Others suggested ways to boost revenue. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said during his Budget statement on Feb 14 that the Government is expecting a deficit of $2 billion, or up to 0.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), for the 2022 financial year, and a deficit of $0.4 billion, or 0.1 per cent of GDP, for the 2023 financial year. While Singapore\u2019s economy has bounced back from the Covid-19 pandemic, the country continues to be in a tight fiscal position, he said. Hence, it was unlikely that the Government would be able to make good on the $40 billion drawn from Singapore\u2019s past reserves in the three financial years of 2020 to 2022 to fund Covid-19 response measures. Making good on reserves\u200b Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson) asked if Mr Wong would give a commitment to put back the money that was taken out of the past reserves \u201cat the earliest opportunity to do so\u201d. She suggested that even if it was not done at one go, it could be done in phases. While it was necessary for the Government to spend money to help Singaporeans get through difficult times, she said, it was also important to guard the reserves and ensure they are not depleted. \u201cOur pioneers took more than 50 years to save up this pot of gold because they want to protect their children and future generations,\u201d she added. \u201cSimilarly, we too have a duty to use this pot of gold wisely and make sure that we put back what we took once we can so that our children and their children will continue to have this asset to fall back on when they face the crisis of their generation.\u201d Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) suggested alternative investments to build up the reserves again, such as syariah-compliant bonds, or sukuk, used in Islamic finance. He noted how demand for green sukuk and environmental, social, and governance sukuk has grown. Building fiscal firepower and resilience\u200b Singapore cannot afford to stop building its reserves and must husband its resources prudently, said Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), since this is the best defence against any future external shocks. Having a healthy fiscal space has allowed the country to plan ahead, such as when the Jurong Island liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals were built at a cost of $1.7 billion more than a decade ago, he added. He said that when the war in Ukraine disrupted the supply of piped gas from Russia, many European countries had to scramble to build LNG terminals. He noted that the LNG terminals here have boosted Singapore\u2019s energy security. Citing another example, he said the economic blockade on Qatar by its neighbours in 2017 had caused food prices to increase, forcing the country to look for alternative sources of supplies. Building resilience, he added, requires significant financial commitments and hence the need for adequate fiscal capacity. Alcohol, gambling and sugar taxes\u200b Meanwhile, Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) asked how special transfers, including top-ups to endowment funds and trust funds, would affect Singapore\u2019s fiscal space, noting that these transfers were revised up to $9.2 billion in the 2022 financial year, up $2.9 billion from the estimated figure. Given the tight fiscal space, the Government will need to continue to review its fiscal strategies, she said, suggesting that it may be worthwhile to raise gambling and alcohol taxes and also introduce a tax on sugar. Room for those who are better off to contribute more\u200b Workers\u2019 Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) also made suggestions for boosting revenue, saying that there is room for those who are better off to contribute more. He called for income tax on the net annual value of property \u2013 removed in 2010 \u2013 to be reintroduced for those who own higher-value homes or secondary residences. The threshold for this should be set at a suitably high level so it can be effective as a wealth tax targeting those who can afford good class bungalows or afford not to rent out their secondary residential properties, he said. Mr Chua also asked about the cumulative budget deficit from the start of the Government\u2019s term in 2020 to the financial year of 2023, and questioned if the constitutional requirement to maintain a balanced budget for each term of government would constrain the Government\u2019s ability to spend if the need arises. Ample fiscal space?\u200b But Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai asserted that the numbers cited by Mr Wong did not show the true picture. Not only is Singapore not in a tight fiscal space, but the Government\u2019s spending during the Covid-19 pandemic also illustrates the strength of the country\u2019s fiscal position, he said, adding that there was \u201cslack\u201d in the Budget.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - The taxman has launched an audit of property investors who have used a loophole \u201c99-to-1\u201d sales contract to dodge paying the additional buyer\u2019s stamp duty (ABSD). The Straits Times has learnt that letters are being sent to some first-time buyers of private real estate to demand that they explain why they signed fresh agreements to sell just 1 per cent of the same properties to their relatives barely a week after exercising the purchase options. Such backdoor deals allow those relatives who own other properties to become co-owners and co-applicants for bank loans without being involved in the main purchases, which would have attracted the ABSD. The audit by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) will ruffle the property investment community because such cases are apparently quite common. A veteran financial planner told ST that he came across about five cases recently. A property agent added that he was not surprised by the audit because he knew that quite a number of buyers at property launches were advised to exploit \u201cthis loophole\u201d to bring in co-owners later, as they were not required to have bank loans ready when confirming their purchases with the developers. Iras letters seen by ST showed that the audit was for transactions that took place in 2021, but the investigation is likely to target all cases involving such agreements, as there is no time bar for such probes. An Iras spokesman declined to provide details of the audit, but said: \u201cIras takes a stern view of any arrangements for the purpose of reducing or avoiding tax. This includes the scenario where buyers purchase properties under a contrived or artificial arrangement in order to reduce or avoid the ABSD they have to pay.\u201d Cases that are being audited have common factors: The first buyers did not own any real estate, so when they bought properties, seemingly for themselves, they did not have to pay ABSD. Shortly after, they signed 99-to-1 agreements to sell just 1 per cent of the same properties to relatives who have other residential units. Such two-stage deals are done because the first buyers do not have sufficient incomes for bank loans, and so they need co-owners to be co-applicants. If they buy the unit together from the start, ABSD is payable so long as one of the parties is a home owner. By getting a second co-owner to buy the 1 per cent share later, they think they need to pay ABSD only for that minute portion, thus saving 99 per cent of the duty. The audit letter asks the first buyers to provide copies of both the first and second sales agreements. They are also asked why they sold a partial share \u201cin such a short period of time\u201d and why the sale to the second buyer comprised only 1 per cent of the property. The Iras spokesman said: \u201cIn cases of tax avoidance, the Commissioner of Stamp Duties will disregard or vary any tax avoidance arrangement, claw back the rightful amount of stamp duty and impose a 50 per cent surcharge.\u201d Singaporeans who have second properties pay 17 per cent ABSD; those with more properties pay 25 per cent. So if the property bought under the 99-to-1 loophole cost $1 million, the total tax plus penalty would be $252,450 if the second Singapore buyer already has a property. If they own more than one, they have to cough up $371,250 in total. Those payments would be $504,900 or $742,500 if the property was worth $2 million. Permanent residents and foreigners pay higher ABSDs, so their penalties would be even heftier if they are caught. And there could be even more pain in store, as Iras notes: \u201cFurther penalties of up to four times the outstanding amount may be imposed if the stamp duty and surcharge are not paid by the deadline.\u201d Singapore\u2019s leading tax expert, Associate Professor Stephen Phua of National University of Singapore Law Faculty, said the audit may potentially implicate lawyers who have helped clients to enter into such arrangements. \u201cThey were under a duty to highlight the risks of doing so to clients,\u201d he said. But the law here does not impose separate penalties on promoters of tax avoidance schemes, unlike in New Zealand and Australia, which deter professionals from helping clients escape paying taxes. There are also rules for compulsory disclosure in Britain. \u201cPerhaps Iras could consider putting in place such measures to combat aggressive or abusive schemes, for the protection of revenue and sound public policies from being undermined,\u201d Prof Phua added.",2023-04-01T17:33:30,middle income

But former engineer Clement Ng Cheng Chuan decided to make a career switch at that age and become a nurse. Having just been retrenched after spending more than 30 years in the oil and gas industry, Mr Ng felt he was not ready to retire. The father of three adult children wanted to do something meaningful. Eventually, he enrolled in a two-year professional conversion programme (PCP) for registered nurses in 2017 and started studying for a nursing diploma. ""I wanted to keep learning and help others, especially the elderly,"" said the now 63-year-old, who works as a staff nurse caring for the elderly at St Luke's Hospital in Bukit Batok. ""I felt that I still had more to contribute and it is better to do something rather than sit at home."" Mr Ng now spends his time ensuring patients receive the right medication, looking after their well-being and following up on doctors' orders. ""It can be quite busy. We cannot predict what could happen next, so we need to react to situations fast,"" he shared. His interest in a nursing career started after a three-month stint as a healthcare assistant at a public hospital in 2017. He later decided to pursue a PCP for registered nurses, where he studied topics such as the human anatomy and picked up lifesaving skills such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillation procedures. His family was concerned he might not be able to cope with the work at his age, but he managed to convince them not to worry. ""They supported my decision and encouraged me,"" said Mr Ng, who hopes to work for as long as he is able to. He noted that age is not a barrier for those who want to take up a career in the healthcare sector. ""It is rewarding when the families appreciate what we have done for their loved ones,"" he added. https://www.straitstimes.com/singap...rough-professional-conversion-programme-at-60",2020-12-10T19:06:33,professional conversion programme

345,642219,Post,['94166694'],https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/all-about-dividends.5064974,,5064974,Forums,All about Dividends,"After many years here, one of the most basic repeated questions has always been about dividends. As such, I will summarise the key points here that any beginner can refer to regarding dividends. I would be using layman terms for the most part so beginners can easily understand. A) Dividends are a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings, decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders. Simply, dividends are what the company pays you for holding their stocks. B) Dividends are not compulsory. It is different from Reits' distribution but the difference isn't gonna mean much to a layman. C) Dividends can be pay out yearly, quarterly, monthly or even randomly without a fixed schedule. Most company that has a culture of paying out dividends though, would adhere to a certain frequency. Commonly found in the US is a quarterly payout. D) Dividends has many dates that will appear to confuse beginners. Just for simplicity's sake, the following are the more important ones to note... 1. Ex-Div, this means excluding dividends . It means if you buy a stock on this day, it excludes the latest dividend payout. Do not buy on this date if you want the dividends. e.g. ex-div is July 27, buy on July 26 or anytime before that to get dividends I repeat, buy before July 27 to get dividends. 2. Pay date or Date Paid/Payable, all means the same. It is the date where you will see the dividends in your bank account. The day you received the $$. Every time a company pays dividends, the ex-div date decide who would get the dividends while the pay date decides when you receive it. 3. CD or Cum-Dividend, it's not important. It basically means including dividends but it might confuse you as a beginner. Go wiki if you really need to know. Just don't bother if it's confusing you. 4. Record date, means nothing to you as a beginner. Don't bother. Go wiki if you really need to know. Just don't bother if it's confusing you. E) Selling, if your sole purpose is to get dividends and you wish to sell the minute you are confirmed that you are entitled to a dividend, sell on ex-div date. How this works is, e.g. ex-div date is August 15, you want to get the dividends, you buy on August 14, hold it to August 15, sell it on August 15, ta-da, you have the dividends. Yes, holding it for a day is all it took. Note that, it's a zero-sum game usually to try this method as the Stock would gap down(meaning move down) to show the pay out of the dividends. E.g. if ex-div is on February 12, the stock price is $10 on Feb 11, the dividends is $1, The stock would most likely open at around $9 on Feb 12, thus taking into account the $1 dividend that is paid out. So if you buy on feb 11 the stock would be $10. On feb 12, the stock would be $9, and you will be entitled to a $1 dividend. The above is the usual case but there are exceptions where the stock swings back up immediately to the price pre-exdiv or $10 in this case. But the fall is nearly always gonna happen. F) Also, dividends stocks in SG are not taxable. You will receive whatever amount is declared to be the dividends paid out. The tax is already done at the corporate stage, don't need to worry about it. G) Another thing is dividends cash/shares options. A company can choose to pay you either with dividends shares or cash($), both the shares and the cash should come to about the same value though sometimes there might be a discount given for taking shares. OCBC recently gives out discounted shares, i.e. their stock price per share is for example $10.30, they give you shares for $9.70. That means if you are suppose to receive $19.40 in dividends, you will get to receive 2 shares of OCBC if you pick to take shares instead of dividends cash. You cannot choose both. Also, if your dividend cash has any left over, e.g. if you recevied $20 dividends and you choose shares, you will get 2 shares and $0.60 cash back into your bank account. I'm not sure about this but will update when someone can clarify. edit: ok, scb will round down any odd shares so it's best to choose cash. As for shares round up/down, it still depends on the individual counters, always check before subscribing to shares or you might lose the leftover cash. H) to find the dividend dates, refer to sgx.com, move your cursor to Company Information(the 2nd blue bar at the top), choose Corporate Action from the drop down list, and you will see all the dates for the dividends. If you need to find a particular company's dividends, use the 'Company Name:' to find it. I) Special dividends, these are dividends that are on top of the usual payout you see from the company, it is usually a 1 time thing and should be treated as a bonus. J) Rights and other offers, this you will need to wiki. Hope the above clears up most doubts people have with regards to dividends. Feel free to correct any mistakes you see and I will update this post.",2015-05-29T22:31:53,central provident fund

The net result is that locals can take on the jobs at \u201cslightly higher levels\u201d , Dr Tan said, citing findings from internal studies by his ministry on foreign workforce policies. \u201cThis has therefore informed our approach of remaining open to high quality foreign professionals while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of Work Permit holders through quotas and also levies,\u201d he said. However, there is a limit to how much the government can tighten access to lower-skilled foreign workers, due to the size of Singapore\u2019s population, Dr Tan pointed out. Continuing to do so would have a \u201cworse-off\u201d effect on Singapore\u2019s economic progress and industry development, he added. Noting that the same correlation of tightening foreign worker access and improving local employment does not apply at higher skill levels, Perera asked if this meant that Singapore is not producing enough highly skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating. Disagreeing, Dr Tan said: \u201cWe are already doing significantly more to improve on the prospects in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, in the upskilling, in upgrading.\u201d But accelerating changes have forced economies and industries to evolve rapidly, alongside other significant disruptions, he said. \u201cTo keep pace with those and to keep ahead pre-emptively, in terms of making sure that we\u2019re ahead of the competition, we will not just need to develop our own local talent, we will also need foreign workers to come alongside with us and complement us as we move forward.\u201d Dr Tan noted however that the studies \u201care but just one input to the entire policymaking process\u201d, adding that they have their limitations. \u201cFor example, they are unable to account for less quantifiable effects of having foreigners in our workplace and our workforce, such as the knowledge spillovers to locals and other network effects,\u201d he said. This means the impact of the interventions studied might also change if they are applied beyond a certain scale or at a different time period. The studies need to be interpreted carefully with other sources of information, including more recent labour market statistics and industry feedback, he said. https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/si...rkers-more-likely-improve-job-outcomes-locals",2023-02-27T13:29:15,middle income

For Mr Desmond Ng, 51, the decision to quit working and return to school to pursue his passion for nursing was not an impulsive one. The full-time second-year student, who is doing a Nitec in nursing at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College East, was inspired by how nurses took care of his late grandmother. She was in and out of the hospital for three years before she died early last year at 103. Mr Ng, who is single, told The New Paper: ""I was impressed by how professional they were when looking after my granny, even if it was a messy and smelly situation that even I found hard to handle - and I was very close to her. ""I could feel they truly cared for her, and that moved me to want to be like them."" Mr Ng, who has two older sisters, lives with his parents who are in their 80s. He was grateful for his family's support when he decided to enrol in ITE in January last year. He said: ""My sisters were happy that I wanted to do something meaningful, and my parents did not object as they would benefit from my nursing skills in the future."" This is not the first time Mr Ng has made a bold career switch. He was an operations manager at SkillsFuture Singapore before attending ITE and had 19 years of experience in administrative roles. Prior to that, he was a pastry chef at Mandarin Oriental Hotel for nine years. He said: ""It takes courage to make the decision (to switch careers), but I want to challenge myself to new things. I take it as there is no turning back, so I have to give it my best."" Adapting to school has not been easy for Mr Ng, whose highest educational qualification is the N levels, so he told himself he has to put in ""three times the effort"" compared with his teenage peers. ""Initially, I was fearful because I had not studied anything related to biology and was afraid I could not cope or understand. But the teachers at ITE taught in such a well-structured way that as long as I put in effort, I could follow, and it really boosted my confidence."" His hard work paid off as he holds a perfect 4.0 grade point average entering his last semester. Apart from in-class lessons, he has also completed six months of supervised clinical attachment - the practical part of the curriculum at ITE - at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Applying the skills he learnt in school to help patients has made him more determined to become a nurse. He said: ""Some would say, 'Thank you and see you outside,' which really makes me very happy, knowing that I have helped them recover."" Sponsored under the Professional Conversion Programme by SGH, Mr Ng will work there as a nurse after graduating in January. He looks forward to giving back to society soon and hopes this will be his last job before retirement. ""I want to be a nurse for 10, maybe 15 years. I want to do it for as long as I can."" 51-year-old pursues passion by studying nursing at ITE The first question he gets from his classmates is always: ""How old are you?""

While sipping her drink, his wife discovered something at the bottom of the cup, under the ice. ""She asked me if I had bought the sugarcane juice with lemon and I told her that I did not do so,"" he added. His wife then proceeded to use a chopstick to fish out the item.

Yong added that his family then filed a police report over the matter. He said they negotiated with the hawker centre's management about his wife's medical treatment: ""It was initially agreed that medical checkup and tests will be paid (for) by their management, thereafter any subsequent medical consultations/tests and treatments if needed , (will also) be borne by them. To be impartial, we would prefer an independent clinic (instead of their company doctor) for the medical consultation. However, the letter of negotiation was drafted several times. It practically differed from the terms during the verbal discussions that were made to us."" Allegedly told by the management not to share the incident on social media\u200b Yong added that all parties eventually agreed to go to the Raffles Medical Clinic at NEX shopping mall at about 7.30pm. Yong then alleged that following the consultation at the clinic, the hawker centre's management supposedly told his family that they will pay for the check-up on the condition that the family would consider the matter closed and would not share about it on social media. Yong criticised the move as insincere and added that the hawker centre appeared to be ""merely thinking about their reputation."" The family therefore decided to pay for the cost of the consultation themselves. Photo courtesy of Yong.

His wife also began to experience nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting on Mar. 27. They made another visit to a Raffles Medical Clinic located at Bishan, where his wife was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis. Photo courtesy of Yong. Yong added that as of Mar. 29, his wife is slowly recovering from this ""traumatic experience"". Hawker centre: Wife claimed tissue paper could give her HIV and syphilis\u200b In response to Mothership's queries, a representative of the hawker centre's management confirmed that Yong's wife met with the food court manager of Balestier Market Hawker Centre about 20 minutes after she had purchased her drink. The hawker centre representative claimed that during this meeting, Yong's wife had allegedly raised concerns about contracting various diseases from the tissue paper in her drink. In addition, Yong's wife had supposedly further alleged that some of these diseases could cause her to develop terminal illness a few years later, which the hawker centre's management found ""unreasonable and unacceptable"". She also shared a memorandum from the consultation on Mar. 26, in which the doctor said that the risk of contracting the ""very common"" herpes simplex virus (HSV) Type 1 from exposure to contaminated saliva was ""theoretical"", and even if Yong's wife ultimately tested positive for it, there would be no way to link it to this incident.

When the authorities arrived at 3.50pm, according to her, they advised both parties to settle among themselves.

No further police assistance was required.""

She also said she told the family that if they publicise the incident, the management might have to reconsider their offer to pay for subsequent consultation or hospitalisation fees.

The latest figure, announced Friday, is lower than Singapore's previous low of 1.1 set in 2020 and lower than Japan's 2021 level. The resident total fertility rate refers to the average number of live births a woman has during her reproductive years. Indranee Rajah, who serves as minister in the Prime Minister's Office, told a parliamentary committee that the falling fertility rate was because of people marrying later and parents caring for older family members at the same time as children as the population grays. The decline also was partly due to the Year of the Tiger ""in the lunar calendar, which is generally associated with lower births among the Chinese,"" the minister said. But critics point to a high cost of living in the city state as a deeper cause. About 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing under the Housing & Development Board (HDB). Prices of these homes continue to rise, which contributes to couples waiting longer to marry and start a family. In this month's budget proposal, the government called for bigger cash payouts at birth, a doubling of parental leave for fathers and increased support for HDB home purchases. A total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered ""replacement level,"" which represents the average number of children a woman would need to have to reproduce herself by bearing a daughter who survives to childbearing age, according to the United Nations. Singapore is not the only Asian economy facing demographic headwinds. South Korea's total fertility rate fell to a new low of 0.78 last year, the lowest out of the 38 members of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Japan, which had a fertility rate of 1.3 in 2021, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government has vowed to increase the budget for child rearing support .",2023-02-26T11:05:13,disposable income

Most of these patients did not require emergency care, and such unnecessary visits to the EDs risk compromising the standard of care for other patients who genuinely require emergency medical care. 2.  The Children\u2019s Emergency (CE) departments at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital and National University Hospital have experienced very high attendances over the past two weeks. This week, there were on average more than 650 cases per day across both CEs, up from an average of 450 cases per day in early January. Approximately 80% of the patients, including those with COVID-19 infections, presented with mild symptoms, did not require hospitalisation, and were discharged after their ED visits. Amongst paediatric patients who were admitted, most did not stay long in hospital, and were discharged on average within two to three days. The proportion of severe COVID-19 infections and Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) remains low, at less than 1 out of 1,000 paediatric cases. 3.  We advise the public to seek medical treatment at a hospital\u2019s ED only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable bleeding. This allows those with severe illness in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly. It also helps to preserve our hospital capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care. 4.  We urge members of the public, including children, to visit their General Practitioners (GP) or a 24-hour clinic for non-emergencies. If COVID-19 testing or review for symptoms of acute respiratory infection is needed, they can visit Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) for further assessment. Over 700 PHPCs are open after office hours on selected days.

Paramedics already under significant pressure...,"Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) urge members of the public to only call 995 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for life-threatening emergencies[1]. 2. 995 EMS calls to SCDF have increased from an average of 635 calls a day in January 2022 to an average of 830 calls a day in the first two weeks of February 2022. On 14 February 2022, SCDF experienced an even sharper spike to about 1,000 calls. This has added significant stress on our paramedics who are already under significant pressure. In comparison, the average daily number of EMS calls before COVID-19 was only about 550. 3. Approximately 1,700 calls in January 2022 and about 2,500 calls in the first two weeks of February 2022 were from COVID-19 patients. However, about 45% of them only needed day treatment at the hospital and did not need to be hospitalised. 4. SCDF 995 EMS are meant to provide swift conveyance to hospital for people with life-threatening and emergency medical conditions. They need to be prioritised for such. Hence, we appeal to individuals who are not suffering any life-threatening or emergency medical conditions[2] to refrain from calling 995. If EMS calls continue to climb, the public may experience delays in ambulance response even for medical emergencies. 5. In the first two weeks of February 2022, our public hospitals saw a high number of patients at their ED, an average of about 3,100 a day, resulting in long queues and waiting times. This is an increase of about 15% compared to January. Up to 80% of these patients needed only day treatment at the ED and did not need to be hospitalised. If many patients with non-emergency conditions turn up at the ED, it could compromise the provision of emergency medical care for those who really require it. We urge the public to seek medical treatment at a hospital\u2019s ED only for serious or life-threatening emergencies. 6. MOH and SCDF have worked together to streamline the triaging and conveyance of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients who are stable and do not require any management of acute emergency symptoms, will be conveyed by SCDF to a COVID-19 Treatment Facility (CTF) directly if they are assessed to require further medical monitoring and management of non-emergency medical conditions. This direct conveyance will begin with the CTF at NTUC Health Nursing Home at Tampines from 26 February 2022. 7. Individuals who are under the Home Recovery Programme or awaiting conveyance to a care or isolation facility, and who are experiencing only mild symptoms, are advised to first seek medical help via the following channels, rather than to call 995 or walk into EDs: a. A telemedicine provider (go.gov.sg/telemedicineproviders); b. Their regular primary care provider; or c. The HR Buddy hotline (6874 4939). 8. Those who have self-tested positive on a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) and have no or mild symptoms, should simply self-isolate at home, for at least 72 hours. If really necessary, they can book an appointment at any Combined Test Centre (CTC) or Quick Test Centre (QTC) to do a supervised self-administered ART. If they are feeling unwell or experiencing symptoms such as fever or persistent cough, they can visit a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) via private transport for medical attention. The public may access the latest list of General Practitioner (GP) clinics and their operating hours at: \u2022 MOH website \u2022 The Agency for Integrated Care\u2019s (AIC) website; \u2022 Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) webpage; and \u2022 HealthHub mobile application, which is available on both the App Store and the Google Play Store. 9. As we transit to living with COVID-19, appropriate and prudent use of 995 EMS and ED services are important. It will ensure that patients truly requiring emergency medical care are able to receive it in a timely manner. [1] These conditions include sudden onset of chest pain, breathlessness, drowsiness or confusion, sudden onset of limb or body weakness, difficulty in speech, or drooping of the face, severe bleeding from injuries, loss of consciousness, and unexplained jerking of the body or fits. [2] Non-life threatening conditions include cases such as bone fracture, cuts with bleeding and accidents with bruising or swelling.

The increase was the most significant in the information and digital technologies course cluster, which saw the median gross monthly salary of those in full-time jobs increase from S$5,000 in 2021 to S$5,625 in 2022. This cluster, along with health sciences and engineering clusters, recorded the highest percentage of full-time permanent employment. The remaining clusters also saw increases in median gross monthly salary, though the salaries for the arts, design and media clusters held steady. Image: NUS, NTU, SMU, SUSS, SIT, SUTD A follow-up survey which polled close to 800 graduates in courses that typically require post-graduate practical training before the graduates can practise in their professions, found fewer graduates were employed after the completion of their practical training in 2022, compared with in 2021.

While wages have generally increased over time, the rise in housing prices has outpaced wage growth in recent years. According to data from the Department of Statistics Singapore, median monthly income from work has increased steadily over the past decade. From 2010 to 2020, the median monthly income for full-time employed residents rose from SGD 3,427 to SGD 4,534, an increase of about 32%. However, during this same period, the price of housing in Singapore also increased significantly.  According to data from the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the resale price index for HDB flats increased by about 46% from 2010 to 2020. This means that while wages in Singapore have generally increased, they have not kept pace with the rise in housing prices. This has made it increasingly difficult for many Singaporeans to afford a home, especially younger generations who are just starting their careers. The Singapore government has implemented various policies over the years to address this issue, including increasing the supply of public housing and introducing measures to cool down the private housing market. However, the issue of affordable housing remains a concern for many Singaporeans. By the way, the above answer has not taken into account the crazy housing price increase in the past 2 years (2021-2022).

Called Single Room Shared Facilities, this new housing type aims to give tenants greater privacy while providing a community-type living environment, said the Housing Board on Monday. HDB will pilot the initiative at the former Anderson Junior College hostel in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8, which comprises two 11-storey blocks. The site will be able to house 480 tenants in single rooms, fully partitioned out of 240 units. Each room, about 9 sq m, will come fitted with basic furnishings such a single-size bed frame, wardrobe, table, chair, wall shelves and a mini refrigerator. Tenants will have to buy their own mattress for hygiene reasons, said HDB. The 24 tenants on each level will share common facilities such as toilets, and kitchens equipped with five cooking stoves, sinks and cabinets. They will also share laundry and activity rooms, as well as dining areas repurposed from former study rooms. This set-up is unlike the Joint Singles Scheme Operator-Run model implemented in end-2021, which pairs singles to share a one- or two-room HDB flat which are semi-partitioned. Speaking to reporters after a tour of a sample unit, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the former hostel site was picked to reduce the preparation time to start the pilot as HDB could \u201cmake do with the existing infrastructure and make adjustments to it\u201d. \u201cIf we do make this a permanent feature of our rental flat offerings, there will be of course changes to the configurations and the ratio (of tenants to facilities). This is using existing infrastructure and making do with what we have to test out this model,\u201d he added. Mr Lee said the pilot will run for one to two years for HDB to collect data on whether the model will work, and if it should be included among the Government\u2019s public rental schemes. The former hostel site is currently still being fitted out, and singles will be able to apply individually in end-2023 when it is ready. The prevailing public rental eligibility criteria for singles will apply. An operator will be appointed to manage the site, including managing tenancy matters and providing social support, as well as furnishing and maintaining the premises, said HDB.

HOME TIPS HDB Essential Occupier: How to apply, Pros and Cons? (2023)\u200b Brb, avoiding ABSD and trying get the maximum 75 per cent bank home loan\u200b March 13, 2023 *Editor\u2019s Note: Article updated to answer readers\u2019 questions Any person who is listed as an essential occupier in a new flat purchased directly from the Housing Board ( HDB ), a resale flat under the CPF Housing Grant scheme, a Design Build and Sell Scheme ( DBSS ) flat or an executive condominium (EC) , must continue to be listed, and physically and continuously occupy the flat during the five-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP). He or she cannot own foreign or local private property until after the five-year MOP, and HDB must be notified before the Option to Purchase for a private property is exercised. Wait. Doesn\u2019t this sound familiar, like the rules applied to HDB flat owners? What is the difference between an essential occupier and an owner, then? An essential occupier, as defined by HDB, \u201cis a family member who forms a family nucleus with the applicant to qualify for a flat from HDB\u201d. This can be a spouse, child, parent or sibling. He/she does not have any share in the flat, even if he has paid cash for it. An owner or co-owner, on the other hand, has full rights to the flat, regardless of whether he/ she paid any money. Being an essential occupier can have wide-reaching effects on one\u2019s life. In extreme cases, it can lead to expensive consequences. How to apply for HDB Essential Occupier?\u200b I recently applied to change my HDB co-ownership status to occupier. Now, if you\u2019re looking to do the same, here\u2019s how my spouse and I did it. Be mindful that this is not legal property advice, but a sharing of how we navigated this elusive essential occupier concept. A friend managed to change her ownership status to essential occupier, and our fellow BTO neighbours successfully did so too in 2022. Everyone has different reasons for doing so: some farsighted couples plan to avoid ABSD for future properties, while others may just want an easier divorce (if it happens). Note that essential occupier and \u201cdecoupling\u201d are often used interchangeably but seem to be different concepts. In layman terms, decoupling happens when a spouse \u201csells\u201d his or her stake in the property to the other spouse \u2013 and that is no longer legal in Singapore between married persons. Under this essential occupier transfer, no \u201cselling\u201d is involved. Change status before key collection : Easier, apply online via HDB Change status after key collection : At HDB Branch, may be more difficult Step 1: Email HDB Write in to HDB to request for ownership transfer from owner-owner to owner-occupier. There are no automated HDB forms on the HDB website for you to do this. You will have to manually email HDB via the MyRequest@HDB portal (linked) . Select your property Update a change in family nucleus Since HDB\u2019s response time is notoriously slow, I waited for almost 2-3 weeks to receive a reply. Step 2 : Reassessment HDB will inform you that, by changing ownership status, any HDB grants that you have received will be reassessed (and taken away in my case), and you will be charged Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (BSD) again. For me, I was charged $5+k to make this change. In fact, all HDB ownership transfers and changes will be charged BSD. It\u2019s reportedly a new charge. The BSD is tiered (just like tax), and you can check and calculate it on the HDB and IRAS website based on your property\u2019s value. If you have received significant amounts of grant, you may want to reconsider your ownership status change. Step 3: Redo Paperwork Prepare both of you and your spouse\u2019s salary pay slips and CPF contributions once again, email it to HDB again for income and eligibility reassessment. Wait for reply and reassessment. Step 4: Visit HDB Hub Arrange appointment for both owner and essential occupier to visit HDB Hub to sign the papers and pay BSD.

Conducted by the European Chamber of Commerce, Singapore (EuroCham), the survey aimed to assess the extent and severity of the impact of rising costs of rental on business operations in Singapore. The report on the survey, released on Monday (March 27), warned that the situation is ""not sustainable"". If business costs do not fall or the Government does not step in to help, then ""Singapore will lose its attractiveness to foreign companies which will decide to relocate their offices to neighbouring countries"", the report said. \u201c This is the first time in the past 10 years where companies have expressed a readiness to leave Singapore should rental prices increase. European Chamber of Commerce's president Federico Donato \u201d The survey was done in collaboration with 14 European national business groups, the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce, the British Chamber of Commerce Singapore and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Singapore. READ ALSO Expats baulk at rising rents, as some think twice about staying in Singapore amid intensifying global talent war In all, 268 local and international businesses operating in Singapore, which are members of these chambers of commerce, responded to the survey. \u201cThis is the first time in the past 10 years where companies have expressed a readiness to leave Singapore should rental prices increase,\u201d said EuroCham president Federico Donato in reply to TODAY\u2019s queries. TODAY on Sunday reported how some expatriates here are intending to leave Singapore amid the skyrocketing rental prices \u2014 which rose at the fastest pace in 15 years last year, outpacing some other major cities. IMPACT ON EXPATRIATES The survey found that 50 per cent of employees who have had to renew their residential housing lease this year or last year had faced rental increases of more than 40 per cent. Another 36 per cent found that the hike was between 20 and 40 per cent. \u201cIt is a significant increase that has a direct consequence on European expatriates and businesses in the city-state,\u201d said the report. READ ALSO The Big Read in short: Impact of high rents on doing business As many as 62 per cent either received less than S$1,500 a month or nothing at all from their companies to offset the rent increase. ADVERTISEMENT Beyond economic impact, 97 per cent of the companies surveyed indicated that employees exhibited visible anxiety and psychological distress over rising costs of housing rent in Singapore 7 IN 10 BUSINESSES READY TO RELOCATE STAFF Asked to indicate the most important factors that have led to an increase in operational costs, 22 per cent of respondents cited ""increased cost of rental: Residential allowance for employees"". General cost increase due to inflation came in a close second at 21 per cent, followed by rising salaries (18 per cent). On how badly the business has been affected by rising costs of residential rental, more than half, or 53 per cent, gave a rating of four or five on a five-point scale \u2014 with five being the most badly affected. Given the rising costs of operations, 69 per cent of companies indicated they would be ready to relocate their personnel out of Singapore. ADVERTISEMENT READ ALSO S'pore private rental prices jump 30% in 2022, fastest pace in 15 years; experts expect slower rise in 2023 ""European and foreign companies are genuinely considering relocating part of their business outside Singapore,"" said EuroCham in a press release on the survey. In his comments to TODAY, Mr Donato said: \u201cAs the rental has increased by a large extent, Singapore's attractiveness to businesses has likewise been harmed. ""This is the most dire it has been in the last 10 years, from our knowledge."" He added that the survey indicated that it was not just the rental costs but also growing travel and shipping costs, for example, which impose added challenges for the businesses. \u201cEuroCham and the other chambers and member companies hope that the Government can intervene in the housing market to drive down the prices of rent, or implement a price ceiling,\u201d he said. In response to TODAY\u2019s queries on what is being done to help such firms cope with rising costs and whether the Government is looking into extending them more, the Ministry of Trade and Industry referred to a written reply to a parliamentary question last September. In the reply, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said that businesses need to ""continue to improve productivity to overcome the issue of rising costs"". He listed schemes to boost productivity such as the Productivity Solutions Grant to support transformation efforts and the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit to support workers\u2019 upskilling efforts. TODAY separately sent queries to the Economic Development Board (EDB) on when was the last time Singapore experienced a significant relocation of companies to other countries, among other questions. In response, an EDB spokesman said that rents in Singapore are comparable to major cities. The recent rise in rents in Singapore is a phenomenon also seen in other cities around the world due to pandemic-related construction delays and post-pandemic economy recovery, the spokesman added. The rental spike here is further linked to strong demand from companies and global talent to relocate to Singapore, as the nation continues to draw investments from businesses seeking to tap into the growth of Asia. ""Our attractiveness lies in our good digital and logistics connectivity, skilled workforce as well as our vibrant innovation and start-up ecosystem,"" the spokesman said. ""We are also a liveable city and safe haven for top talent, given our world class healthcare system, education system, connectivity and rule of law."" The spokesman added that according to the Ministry of National Development, residential prices in Singapore are expected to stabilise further as cooling measures work their way through the market and more supply comes on stream. Furthermore, there are also early signs that both the resale and rental markets are slowing down. Last week, EDB managing director Jacqueline Poh also took to LinkedIn to comment on the sharp hikes in residential rental prices, especially in prime areas. She noted two \u201cimportant facts\u201d that are overlooked when discussing the issue. \u201cRentals did not rise significantly for a decade before Covid. (And) as a result, even now rents are comparable to many major cities, especially if you look beyond specific \u2018hot\u2019 districts,\u201d Ms Poh wrote. She concluded the post by saying that 100,000 private and public homes are set to be completed by 2025, with 40 per cent of them to be completed by this year. \u201cThis increase in supply should help relieve the pressure and moderate the cost of living.\u201d REGIONAL CITIES ARE CATCHING UP: ECONOMIST Economist Walter Theseira said that the Government has previously intervened to develop appropriate industrial spaces and support housing for foreign talent, such as via the development of Jurong Industrial Estate and the implementation of the Scheme for Housing of Foreign Talent. However, a direct intervention in the market would risk \u201cthe possibility of harming the economy by stopping the natural flow of more value-added businesses which will displace lower value-added ones\u201d, said the associate professor from the Singapore University of Social Sciences. One reason that Singapore is expensive is the large number of businesses and people that want to be here, he said. \u201c Singapore has to be the superior choice for high value added business even with high costs. Economist Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences \u201d Regional cities are catching up in various ways such as in terms of quality of manpower, infrastructure and quality of life, Assoc Prof Theseira said. To remain competitive, Singapore must maintain \u201ca particular niche or competitiveness so that people still want to be here\u201d regardless of these costs, he said, giving the example of how the San Francisco bay area, despite being \u201cnotoriously expensive\u201d, remains attractive to startups. \u201cSingapore has to be the superior choice for high-value-added business even with high costs,\u201d he said.

The Master of Management programme will cover modules related to impactful leadership, corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, and leading through digital disruption. The course will be made available to all SIA Group employees at a later stage. Meanwhile, a minor in aviation management course was also launched on Tuesday for undergraduates at SUSS. Speaking at the launch of the programme, SFC chairman Quay Chew Eng said: \u201cWith the launch of these two programmes, we take another step in the journey to support and promote lifelong learning in the aviation sector. This will help us to attract and retain the next generation of pilots and leaders (and) entrench Singapore\u2019s position as a global hub and support its future growth.\u201d Participants will learn from aviation case studies and hear from guest speakers within the industry. The course can be completed in a year, 18 months or even up to four years. Some of its modules can also be taken by SIA pilots overseas. Captain Darren Lim, a 43-year-old SIA pilot, has been taking modules during the programme\u2019s soft launch in January while flying for the national carrier. Capt Lim, who has 18 years of flying experience, said he finds the modules interesting, particularly those on sustainability and leadership. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve been getting to know more about management (and have been) learning new and different management concepts and understanding how they can be put into practice.\u201d Transport Minister S. Iswaran told Parliament earlier in March that the aviation sector has made a strong recovery from the debilitating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The aviation workforce \u2013 currently at 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels \u2013 is also expected to recover fully by 2023, he said. The International Civil Aviation Organisation has predicted that by 2026, the world will require 25,000 new aircraft in addition to the existing 17,000 worldwide, and 480,000 technicians and 350,000 pilots to operate them. Of these, 243,000 technicians and 185,000 pilots are expected to come from the Asia-Pacific. To further boost the aviation industry, SUSS\u2019 minor in aviation management course will be open to undergraduates in any of its programmes with a minor option. It is the only course to include unmanned aircraft theory and practice. Those who complete the modules on unmanned aircraft operations can apply to get an Unmanned Aircraft Pilot Licence. Minister of Education Chan Chun Sing, who was a guest of honour the course\u2019s launch, tried his hand at a virtual reality (VR) demonstration of flying an unmanned aircraft, or drone. Applications for the minor programme are open for up to 50 undergraduates for the July semester. The course will cover supply and demand in the aviation supply chain, airport operations, airline business models, modelling applications and aviation performance measures, among other topics. The aim is to provide career paths for students in airport ground handling, airport management, airline ground operations, airline flight operations and airline commercial management. Speaking at the launch, Professor Tan Tai Yong, the president of SUSS, said: \u201cThese programmes will equip Singapore with a pool of skilled professionals with in-depth knowledge and recognised skills sought after by aviation employers.\u201d Prof Tan added: \u201cOur partnership with SFC is an excellent example that academia and industry can co-develop programs with good outcomes.\u201d The launch was held at SUSS and attended by more than 60 academic, corporate, community and government leaders.",2023-03-14T18:16:22,education subsidies

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE \u2013 Direct sales company Herbalife has won its appeal to the High Court against the taxman over the value of the products it supplies to its members on which goods and services tax is levied. Herbalife sells nutritional supplements, weight-management products and other personal care products to its members at varying discount tiers, from the standard 25 per cent and up to 50 per cent. It is not disputed that the products supplied by Herbalife to its members are liable to GST, but the issue is how such supplies should be valued. The issue in contention in the case is whether the discounted rate is taken as the value of the supply, as contended by Herbalife, or the open market value of the nutritional products, as argued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras). In a judgment on Monday, Justice Choo Han Teck ruled in Herbalife\u2019s favour. Justice Choo accepted that Herbalife\u2019s business model results in revenue leakage, but said the question is how it ought to be plugged. The judge said the solution to the revenue leakage lies not in expanding the scope of non-monetary consideration, but in the adoption of a special valuation provision such the one adopted in the United Kingdom\u2019s Value Added Tax (VAT) Act. The UK law specifically addresses business models akin to Herbalife without the potential negative collateral effects on commercial practices. But this is beyond the power of the courts in Singapore, and must be implemented legislatively, said Justice Choo. Iras had issued notices of assessment to Herbalife for the accounting periods of Jan 1, 2012, to March 31, 2017, on the basis that the supplies were valued at open market value. The disputed amount of GST involved in the appeal is slightly under $2.2 million, inclusive of the 5 per cent late payment penalty. Under Herbalife\u2019s direct selling business model, it sells products only to members, who in turn sell them to consumers. Members who sell the products to consumers earn as profit the difference between the price they paid to Herbalife and the price they are contractually bound to sell the products. Members move up the discount tiers as they accumulate volume points, which are credited for their own purchases as well as the purchases of the new members they refer to Herbalife, known as downlines. Iras argued that if the members were GST-registered, the final sale to end-consumers would be taxable supplies and GST would be levied on the full price, which is the contractually stated retail price of the products without the tiered discount. Because the members are not GST-registered, the only taxable supply is the supply between Herbalife and the members. The tax man said that by inserting a non-taxable intermediary between Herbalife and the final consumer, the difference between the price at which the product is sold to the intermediaries and the final retail price consumers pay is not taxed. This results in the revenue leakage, said Iras, which added that this loss of revenue is addressed by Section 17(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act. The provision states that if goods are supplied in exchange for a consideration, or payment, not wholly consisting of money, the value of the supply shall be taken to be its open market value. Iras contended that the open market value is the retail price of the products less the standard discount of 25 per cent. But Herbalife, represented by Mr Vikna Rajah, argued that this provision does not apply. He said a similar provision in the UK VAT Act was unable to bring to tax goods sold via a direct selling business model, thereby requiring the enactment of a special valuation provision. Since this special valuation provision is absent in Singapore\u2019s GST Act, he argued that there is a lacuna, or a gap, that has to be filled by Parliament.",2023-03-06T21:39:46,wealth tax

Shailey Hingorani \u200b SINGAPORE: Women\u2019s rights advocates woke up to a pleasant surprise on Sunday (Sep 20) morning when the Government announced Singapore\u2019s first-ever review of women\u2019s issues , with a view to identifying and tackling gender inequality. Besides the announcement itself, the way the review was framed is extraordinary. Instead of focusing on short-term concerns, the review will look at \u201cunderlying, structural issues\u201d, to ensure that gender equality becomes a fundamental value. For a society where that principle is, unfortunately, not enshrined in its Constitution, this shift is all the more laudable. For far too long, we have foregrounded individual examples of the discrimination, exploitation, harassment and objectification that women confront in numerous arenas . We focus on each week\u2019s carousel of stories on over 400 illicit videos taken by an undergraduate, sexual harassment in a Grab ride or alleged mile-high molest \u2013 and then move on. We\u2019re not seeing the bigger picture. Gender inequality forms the bedrock of women\u2019s experiences of life. It starts from the personal, from the time a person is born. It is reinforced by culture, policies, laws and institutions as she moves through the world. We cannot achieve any societal objectives relating to the challenges facing women \u2013 whether in suffering violence, managing reproduction, working or supporting families \u2013 without this systemic understanding, this feminist lens. At AWARE, where we have been advocating for women\u2019s rights for 35 years, we are optimistic this review will be a turning point in our country\u2019s journey to equality. \u200b We would suggest a sharper focus be placed on three key areas: The uneven share of care responsibilities, gender-based discrimination and harassment at work, and the sexual objectification of women. THE UNEVEN SHARE OF CARE WORK Caregiving and housework are everyday tasks that maintain life, both daily and generationally. These include caring directly for oneself and others, including children and the elderly. It also includes maintaining physical spaces and organising resources as part of the indirect process of care \u2013 for example, the tasks of cleaning, cooking and shopping. All this is mostly unpaid, underappreciated work women have traditionally performed for their families and communities. This traditional expectation is rooted in an antiquated idea that certain traits, such as being nurturing and caring, are somehow innate to women - a persistent myth despite plenty of research overturning its biological basis. The International Labour Organisation estimates that in Asia Pacific, women spend 4.1 times more time on unpaid caregiving and housework than men. While no similar time-related data is available for Singapore, other indicators help paint a picture of the nature and effects of caregiving and housework on women. According to Singapore\u2019s Labour Force Survey 2019, of women outside the labour force, 43 per cent are not working because of caregiving and housework responsibilities. By contrast, only 0.04 per cent of men are outside the labour force because of caregiving and housework. We also know that women spend a median of nine years outside the labour force providing eldercare. Caregiving isn\u2019t just exhausting, time-consuming work. It also robs women of their professional incomes without compensating them for their labour. In order to mitigate the heavy burden of caregiving and housework, many households hire migrant domestic workers. Yet these workers (almost all women) also face their own set of challenges, such as long hours and poor compensation. The review should take concrete steps to recommend what a gender-equal Singapore would look like for them, as well. \u200b GENDER-BASED DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT AT WORK Between September 2019 and September 2020, AWARE\u2019s Workplace Harassment and Discrimination Advisory received 172 calls, with over 30 per cent concerning some form of discrimination. Of these, about 80 per cent concerned discrimination against women with maternity and caregiving responsibilities. These women lost job opportunities, were denied promotions and reasonable accommodations, and faced mistrust and suspicion because of their caregiving duties. The same traditional ideas that push women to take on the lion\u2019s share of caregiving at home seem to also make them less \u201creliable\u201d to employers. This discrimination has serious consequences. Women in Singapore are on average paid 6 per cent less than men for performing the same kind of work. They are also concentrated in low-paying jobs, if they do work instead of providing caregiving fulltime. Their need to take breaks from the workforce renders them unable to progress as far and as quickly in their careers as men. Finally, they put less aside for retirement \u2013 women on average have 11 per cent less than men in their CPF accounts.",2022-12-27T08:56:50,elite education

This new requirement, which also applies to domestic helpers, is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses as medical costs rise, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday, highlighting that more than 5 per cent of foreign workers\u2019 medical bills exceed the current $15,000 coverage limit. An average of more than 1,000 employers a year face this issue, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament in March 2022, when he announced the move for additional insurance coverage. MOM estimates that more than 99 per cent of bills for hospitalisation and surgical procedures will fall within the new coverage limit. Under the new rules, employers also have to co-pay 25 per cent of claim amounts that go above the first $15,000. This means that if a worker incurs a $60,000 bill for heart surgery, for instance, the employer will have to pay $11,250, which is 25 per cent of $45,000. The insurer will cover the other $48,750. From July 2025, several other changes will also be implemented. Employers will no longer need to pay for their workers\u2019 medical treatment upfront and claim the amount from insurers later. Insurers will be required to reimburse hospitals directly. There will also be a standard list of allowable exclusions for insurers, such as procedures that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery. Insurers will not have to cover the treatments for pre-existing illnesses occurring within the first 12 months of work under the same employer. Insurers must also offer different premiums for workers aged 50 and below, and those above the age of 50, from July 2025. There were 1,033,500 work permit holders \u2013 of whom 268,500 were maids \u2013 and 177,900 S Pass holders working in Singapore as at the end of last year. Medical bills of migrant workers are not subsidised or covered under national schemes such as MediShield Life and MediFund. MOM said the policy changes are being implemented in phases to give employers and insurers time to adjust to the cost impact. The ministry added: \u201cWith many insurers expressing interest to offer the enhanced medical insurance products, the market will be competitive and employers will have a range of insurers to choose from.\u201d Employers must provide medical insurance coverage of at least $60,000 for maids, migrant workers from July This is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses, said MOM.

Mr Wong, who has over three decades of legal experience, was previously the chairman and a senior partner of Singapore\u2019s largest law firm, Allen & Gledhill. Despite so, Mr Wong is still the first appointed AG without prior experience on the Bench or in the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers. Mr Wong\u2019s predecessor V K Rajah SC \u2014 who was appointed Attorney-General on 25 Jun 2014 \u2014 ended his service as the Attorney-General on 14 Jan 2017 upon reaching the retirement age of 60 years, Mr Wong was 63 years old at the time of his appointment for the first term of his tenure. By the end of his new term in 2026, Mr Wong would be 72 years old. Making him the oldest AG holding onto the appointment since Singapore\u2019s independence. Lee Hsien Loong had raised many questions concerning potential conflict of interest as Singapore\u2019s Attorney-General \u2014 a position that entails acting as a legal advisor to the Government. Two opposition parties highlighted the issue five years ago, as seen in the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP)\u2019s letter to then-President Tony Tan and the Workers\u2019 Party (WP) urging the Government to address the matter in Parliament. The SDP urged Dr Tan to revoke Mr Wong\u2019s position as the Attorney-General, as Mr Wong, in the capacity of the Attorney-General, had allegedly refused to look into Dr Lee Wei Ling\u2019s and Mr Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s allegations regarding PM Lee\u2019s purported abuse of power in the 38 Oxley Road dispute. \u201cMr Lucien Wong was sworn in as AG on 16 January 2017. However, the fact that Mr Wong was the PM\u2019s personal lawyer was revealed to the public only in June 2017. The President may not have been aware of this fact or its full implications. \u201cThe association of Mr Wong with PM Lee prior to his becoming the AG has created an acute conflict of interest which cannot be ignored. It is important that President Tan does the right thing in the interest of the people of Singapore and revoke Mr Lucien Wong\u2019s appointment as AG. \u201cAny further delay or refusal to act will cause even greater erosion of confidence in our public institutions,\u201d the letter read. Low Thia Khiang, former chief of WP \u2014 said that Mr Wong was representing PM Lee\u2019s in his private dispute against his siblings over the Lee family\u2019s private property, and then \u2014 as an Attorney-General \u2014 had the power to advise the Government and the Cabinet on matters related to said property and their late father Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s will pertaining to the house. \u201cIs there also a conflict of interest here? Was this consideration taken into account when (Mr Wong) was appointed the AG? Can the PM clarify the role of the Law Minister and the AG in this matter, and explain to the House whether there\u2019s any conflict of interest,\u201d Mr Low asked. Ms Lim, chairman of the WP, said regarding Mr Wong that it was \u201calso well-known that he had been a senior partner in the same firm as the Law Minister for a long time\u201d. \u201cThey probably understand each other intimately,\u201d she said. Ms Lim also noted how Law Ministers in the past had expressly endorsed the need for there to be a distance between the Government and the AGC. \u201cFor instance, Prof S Jayakumar recently gave an interview for a book marking AGC\u2019s 150th Anniversary. There, he recalled how when he was appointed Minister of State for Law in 1981, he was given an office located at the AGC, then in High Street. \u201cNow, there is no legal prohibition on appointing the Government\u2019s close friends and former party comrades as the AG or Deputy AG \u2026 But, from a system point of view, do these appointments instil public confidence that the AGC will act independently in matters where the Government, or worse, the PM, has an interest in the outcomes?\u201d she asked the House. Article 35(4) of the Constitution stipulates that the Attorney-General may be appointed for a specific period and \u2014 subject to clause (6) \u2014 vacate his office at the end of the period. The Attorney-General is permitted to hold office until the age of 60 years old. However, according to Section 35(4)(b), an Attorney-General who has reached 60 years of age may remain in office for a fixed period of time agreed between the Attorney-General and the Government upon the President\u2019s discretion, if the President takes up the advice of the Prime Minister.

Personal recommendation for average new subscribers and general use cases (no Starhub TV+ or Singtel TV services). Power users can ignore this recommendation. M1>= Starhub > MyRepublic (take note of the CGNAT thingy) > Singtel (not recommended because of ONR) > Whizzcomms (not recommended due to the fact that is get depriotized by Singtel when incidents happen) > Viewquest (not recommended becuase of stability concerns raised) 3) For existing Singtel ONR users (unbridged ONR 1Gbps), you may choose to stay if the limitation of the ONR does not bother you. If you feel the limitation then you may opt to move out. For existing Singtel ONT users for legacy plan and 1Gbps plan, you can keep the ONT upon recontract. However, please  take note you will be given ONR once you move to a new place. For existing bridged Singtel ONR users (bridged ONR for Singtel 1Gbps), you may need to contact Singtel before recontract to make sure they will keep the bridging status of your ONR before recontract. Most likely you can do that. 4) For Dual ISP users: M1+SH, M1+ MR, SH+MR and M1+MR are all good option to go.  M1+VQ or SH+VQ can be a good option as well since you can leverage the good performance of VQ for certain use cases. M1+WC or SH+WC can be considered as well as long as you ask WC to configure the ONR to ONT mode. 5)  DO NOT USE the FREE BUNDLED ROUTER as the base for choosing ISPs. In general, it is better to buy your own router as the free router is not really good. Or in some case, buy the higher end router from the ISP if it is a good deal (eg: M1 GT-AX6000 is a superb deal). But anyway, this is just my personal opionion and many are still using the free router as the base for choosing ISPs becuase they may rely on ISP to provide the technical support (even though the technical support is in general not good). ********************************* All the dual 1Gbps or 2Gbps plans from Singapore ISPs have the same limitation because of the use of GPON ONT. Download is up to 2Gbps combined, upload is up to 1Gbps. All the 1Gbps plans from Singapore ISPs have the same limitation because of the use of GPON ONT. Download is up to 1Gbps combined, upload is up to 1Gbps. Last time only MyRepublic has the lower upload limit at 500Mbps but that has been fixed recently. GPON: Theoreticaly max speed: 2.5 Gbit/s down, 1.25 Gbit/s up (ISPs can further limit the speed to 2Gbps download and 1Gbps upload) Starhub UltraSpeed (10Gbps trial) is using  XGS-PON ( theoretical max speed: 10Gbps download, 10Gbps upload). Singtel 10Gbps plan is using XG-PON ( theoretical max speed: 10Gbps download, 2.5Gbps upload) but will switch to XGS-PON in April 2023. ********************************* 1. SingTel : (1Gbps, 2Gbps, 1+1 Gbps Gamer plan, 10Gbps plan, also have legacy 500Mbps plan for existing users) Public IP: yes, no static add-on ONT users (existing 500Mbps and 1Gbps): 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), VLAN required ONT users (existing  legacy Unlimited 1Gbps Plan): 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), VLAN not required, no Singtel TV ONR users: 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), but you need to request from Singtel and it may not be easy SingTel provide same connection for Internet and Fibre TV, VLAN is needed. For ONR users, Vlan is handled by the ONR. SingTel 1+1Gbps plan, only use ONR. The ONR will be configured as three port unbridged ONR ports and one port bridged ONR port, the bridged port does not require VLAN. Certain users have asked Singtel to provide a special configuration for the ONR with the 1Gbps plan, three ports for SingTel TV only without internet access, one bridged ONR port which does not require VLAN. Note: Singtel has stopped to entertain ONR bridging request since March 2022. Avoid Singtel as an ISP in general unless you are fine with the super basic feature of the Singtel ONR (you can not even set up your own DNS server). Singtel 2Gbps plan: aggregated 2Gbps, must use Singtel ONR, not possible to bridge the ONR Note: avoid this plan as it offers practically benefits compared to 1Gbps plan for majority of the users. Singtel 10Gbps plan: use XG-PON ONR, 1 x 10G LAN port and 4 x 1G LAN ports. After April 2023, it will switch to better 10G-XGS-PON technology. Take not it is using ONR and you can not bridge the ONR. Strong point: very stable, may have some advantages in terms of routing to China and Europe. 2. Starhub (500Mbps, 1Gbps plan and 2Gbps plan, UltraSpeed trial with 10Gbps) Public IP, ONT, no vlan needed. With native dual stack IPv6. Starhub uses different ONT ports to deliver Fibre Internet (ONT Port 1) and Fibre TV if you are using the Fibre TV Set Top box (ONT Port 2). New Starhub TV+ box is different, it needs to be connected to the router. Starhub 2Gbps plan: ONT port 1 and ONT port 3 used to deliver 2x1Gbps connection, ONT port 2 for Starhub Fibre TV. Starhub UltraSpeed 10Gbps trial (fallback to 2Gbps plan if th trial failed). Please take not it is using XGS-PON ONR and you can not bridge the ONR. 3. M1 (500Mbps, 1Gbps plan and 2Gbps plan) Public IP, ONT, no vlan needed. Native dual stack IPv6. Customers can pay for Static IP add-on. M1 2Gbps plan: ONT port 1 and ONT port 2 used to deliver 2x1Gbps connection, 4. MyRepublic (200Mbps, 1Gbps and 1+1 Gbps plan). Using ONT Carrier Grade NAT, no public IP by default. You can pay one time charge of S$50 for the Static IP. No vlan needed. No IPv6. MR is perceived to have good speed and lower latency for some gamers but there are feedbacks of routing performance degradation after the takeover by Starhub. 5.Viewquest (500Mbps, 1Gbps, 2Gbps plan) 500Mbps/1Gbps plan: ONT or ONR (you can bridge) 2Gbps plan: ONR (2Gbps one network plan, aggregated 2Gbps plan similar to Singtel 2Gbps plan), you can not bridge the ONR. You need to pay for static IP add-on to get public IPv4 address. If not they started to use CGNAT like MyRepublic for new users. Existing users may have static IPv4 address for free. No IPv6. VQ is peceived to have good performance and lower latency for some gamers, but there are some staibity concerns based on the feedbacks from the VQ thread. 6. Whizcomms (300Mbps->500Mbps and 1Gbps plan) Public IP, no IPv6. Whizcomms provides ONR, but you can ask them to configure the ONR in ONT mode prior to installation without charges. No Vlan needed. 7. SIMBA (upcoming with 2.5Gbps plan at S$20 per month). SIMBA \u2013 formerly TPG Telecom SIMBA Mobile simba.sg Note: 1. Some people are worried about throttling of BT, here is the what I gathered, just for reference. Take note I myself support the throttling policy for BT. 1) Viewquest=MyRepublic (almost no throttling) > 2) M1 >=Starhub (a bit of throttling) > 3) SingTel (pretty heavy throttling) > Whizcomms (worst); throttling of BT and things like Google Drive Download 2.

Speaking on the third day of the debate on the President's Address in Parliament, Mr Lee acknowledged the anxiety that Singaporeans are feeling about their jobs and the \u201cpalpable\u201d sense of competition with foreigners.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - The taxman has launched an audit of property investors who have used a loophole \u201c99-to-1\u201d sales contract to dodge paying the additional buyer\u2019s stamp duty (ABSD). The Straits Times has learnt that letters are being sent to some first-time buyers of private real estate to demand that they explain why they signed fresh agreements to sell just 1 per cent of the same properties to their relatives barely a week after exercising the purchase options. Such backdoor deals allow those relatives who own other properties to become co-owners and co-applicants for bank loans without being involved in the main purchases, which would have attracted the ABSD. The audit by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) will ruffle the property investment community because such cases are apparently quite common. A veteran financial planner told ST that he came across about five cases recently. A property agent added that he was not surprised by the audit because he knew that quite a number of buyers at property launches were advised to exploit \u201cthis loophole\u201d to bring in co-owners later, as they were not required to have bank loans ready when confirming their purchases with the developers. Iras letters seen by ST showed that the audit was for transactions that took place in 2021, but the investigation is likely to target all cases involving such agreements, as there is no time bar for such probes. An Iras spokesman declined to provide details of the audit, but said: \u201cIras takes a stern view of any arrangements for the purpose of reducing or avoiding tax. This includes the scenario where buyers purchase properties under a contrived or artificial arrangement in order to reduce or avoid the ABSD they have to pay.\u201d Cases that are being audited have common factors: The first buyers did not own any real estate, so when they bought properties, seemingly for themselves, they did not have to pay ABSD. Shortly after, they signed 99-to-1 agreements to sell just 1 per cent of the same properties to relatives who have other residential units. Such two-stage deals are done because the first buyers do not have sufficient incomes for bank loans, and so they need co-owners to be co-applicants. If they buy the unit together from the start, ABSD is payable so long as one of the parties is a home owner. By getting a second co-owner to buy the 1 per cent share later, they think they need to pay ABSD only for that minute portion, thus saving 99 per cent of the duty. The audit letter asks the first buyers to provide copies of both the first and second sales agreements. They are also asked why they sold a partial share \u201cin such a short period of time\u201d and why the sale to the second buyer comprised only 1 per cent of the property. The Iras spokesman said: \u201cIn cases of tax avoidance, the Commissioner of Stamp Duties will disregard or vary any tax avoidance arrangement, claw back the rightful amount of stamp duty and impose a 50 per cent surcharge.\u201d Singaporeans who have second properties pay 17 per cent ABSD; those with more properties pay 25 per cent. So if the property bought under the 99-to-1 loophole cost $1 million, the total tax plus penalty would be $252,450 if the second Singapore buyer already has a property. If they own more than one, they have to cough up $371,250 in total. Those payments would be $504,900 or $742,500 if the property was worth $2 million. Permanent residents and foreigners pay higher ABSDs, so their penalties would be even heftier if they are caught. And there could be even more pain in store, as Iras notes: \u201cFurther penalties of up to four times the outstanding amount may be imposed if the stamp duty and surcharge are not paid by the deadline.\u201d Singapore\u2019s leading tax expert, Associate Professor Stephen Phua of National University of Singapore Law Faculty, said the audit may potentially implicate lawyers who have helped clients to enter into such arrangements. \u201cThey were under a duty to highlight the risks of doing so to clients,\u201d he said. But the law here does not impose separate penalties on promoters of tax avoidance schemes, unlike in New Zealand and Australia, which deter professionals from helping clients escape paying taxes. There are also rules for compulsory disclosure in Britain. \u201cPerhaps Iras could consider putting in place such measures to combat aggressive or abusive schemes, for the protection of revenue and sound public policies from being undermined,\u201d Prof Phua added.",2023-04-01T17:33:30,high income group

Different forms of wealth taxes Taxing immovable objects is a more stable revenue mobiliser and more administratively straightforward than a general wealth tax, which involves trying to value all assets (physical, financial, intangible). This is where a property tax - which is a narrower form of wealth tax - becomes attractive. Although Singapore already imposes various stamp duties and property taxes, there may be scope for the introduction of a capital gains tax on real estate (which is strictly speaking a form of income rather than wealth tax) and/or making taxes on this asset class much more progressive across the board, with additional surcharges on ""luxury properties"" (defined based on a threshold assessed value). Another specific form of wealth tax that is actively under discussion in various countries is the inheritance tax - or its closely related cousin, the estate tax - as a feasible alternative. Unlike a general wealth tax, inheritance and estate taxes continue to be imposed in 24 of 38 OECD countries. In fact, Singapore levied an estate duty in the past but repealed it in 2008 in a quest to help develop its nascent wealth management industry and possibly in response to Hong Kong having done the same in 2006. Circumstances may have changed since then. Singapore is now well established as a wealth hub and its many attributes beyond tax breaks have become quite well-known and appreciated. Added to this is the fact that there seems to be a shift away from unbridled tax competition with economies in the region and elsewhere looking to rein in casino capitalism and unmitigated wealth polarisation.

Commentary: Singapore residents must save for retirement today to continue enjoying low income taxes For direct taxes to remain low, Singapore workers need to do more with their money to prepare for their future retirement, says David Kuo of The Smart Investor. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: The message from the Budget 2023 speech could not have been clearer. It cannot be business as usual for Singapore. Over the last couple of decades, the country has benefited from global trade and finance flows. But with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, Singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. As the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. By 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. Budget 2023 offers targeted support to Singapore\u2019s growing pool of seniors . The ElderCare fund will be topped up by S$500 million, and another S$1.5 billion will be added to the MediFund. But just think about that for a moment. Singapore expects a Budget deficit of S$2 billion in the financial year (FY) of 2022, and a deficit of S$400 million in FY2023. Those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. That is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. If we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won\u2019t need government subsidies. ENSURING OUR RETIREMENT ADEQUACY\u200b As Singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that Singapore workers can do for themselves now. While the Government has kept the rate of contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from S$6,000 to S$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . But this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. If so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. Perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. This number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. A 2019 Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in Singapore is about S$1,400 a month. But considering that the median income per household member in Singapore is about S$3,200 a month, which adds up to S$38,400 per year, let\u2019s work off a round figure of S$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. You can scale this up or down accordingly, but don\u2019t forget to factor in inflation. At an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our S$50,000 target would be equivalent to S$100,000 in around 24 years\u2019 time. And in 48 years\u2019 time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. That, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. That is the income we would need to generate from our savings. Because we don\u2019t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. Taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the CPF Special Account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of S$100,000 a year in 24 years\u2019 time is S$2.5 million. We should ask ourselves if our accumulated CPF contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. If it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. That generally means investing in shares. There is a limit as to how much our CPF money can be invested in the stock market. So, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of CPF. The best time to do that is while we are young. INDIRECT TAXES PREVAIL OVER DIRECT TAXES\u200b Budget 2023 also highlighted the Government\u2019s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. Stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. So too will taxes on luxury cars . We can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. In the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. In the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. However, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. The upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the Government to redistribute wealth. After all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. It is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. SETTING ASIDE MONEY FOR THE NEXT CRISIS\u200b There was another important message in the Budget. While the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. Though Singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year\u2019s Budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. What\u2019s more, Singapore must continue to consciously build up its reserves to prepare for the next crisis. We need to do the same too. The Government has provided Singaporeans with the means to cope with inflationary pressures through voucher schemes . This should help ease some of the pain when we do our daily shopping. More importantly, it buys us time to set aside some money for a rainy day because wages are rising but income tax rates aren\u2019t. It is a window of opportunity that other developed economies have been unable to provide. But we need to fix our roofs when the sun is shining. It will be too late when thunderstorms hit. In summary, Budget 2023 puts households firmly in the driving seat. The Government is treating people as mature adults in a maturing economy. The country\u2019s finances are strong and should be even stronger over time. We too can make our household finances stronger over time by being prudent with our spending and preparing for future uncertainties. If we want our taxes to remain low, we need to do our part to ensure that it stays that way. David Kuo is Co-founder of The Smart Investor.",2023-02-23T09:09:32,wealth tax

A local survey published last month found that the median gross monthly salary of last year's graduates had shot up from S$3,800 in 2021 to S$4,200 (US$2,860 to US$3,160). This was a sharp spike compared with previous years, where median salaries for fresh graduates typically increased by S$100 each year. One mechanical engineering graduate, who took up an operations role in the automotive industry, told CNA that his starting pay was S$3,500 \u2013 well below last year's median salary of S$4,600 for those in the engineering cluster. The 26-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Lewis, graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in May last year. His current job was one of three offers he received within a month of applying for jobs after graduating in May last year. The other two had offered a slightly higher pay of S$3,600 but he eventually settled for his current role due to the company\u2019s reputation and the prospect of receiving bonus payouts of up to six months. Based on his knowledge of the company's typical salary increments, he estimated that his salary would increase by about 5 per cent following his performance appraisal. While this will bump his salary up to S$3,675, it would still be lower than last year\u2019s median pay for his sector. \u201cI do feel a bit left out,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut at this juncture of my career, I\u2019m still very much learning and so my focus isn\u2019t really about how much I\u2019m making, but rather the exposure and experience I\u2019m getting."" Another fresh graduate, who received his degree in information systems from the National University of Singapore (NUS) last May, was offered S$5,200 for a software developer role. The 27-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Keith, successfully negotiated a higher pay of S$5,500. Despite this, his salary is still lower than the median starting pay of S$5,625 for those in the information and digital technologies cluster. But not all graduates from the Class of 2022 have managed to land a job. Another NUS graduate, who received her degree in psychology with a minor in communications and new media in December, is still unemployed and on the search for a full-time job. The 24-year-old, who wanted to be known as Eunice, told CNA she applied for 60 to 70 jobs in various industries since the start of the year but few have responded. \u201cI\u2019m casting my net wide and applying for roles that seem interesting to me, so I have been looking at entry-level and associate roles that suit my skills or are in companies that I really like,\u201d she said. 'Feel a bit left out': Higher salaries for fresh graduates out of reach for some A local survey published last month found that the median starting pay for fresh graduates had shot up to S$4,200. www.channelnewsasia.com",2023-03-30T08:05:49,disposable income

In the city-state\u2019s latest bi-monthly auction, 125 bidders successfully offered as much as S$116,020 just for the right to own an \u201copen category\u201d auto, which can be applied towards any vehicle type but frequently ends up being used for larger cars in the densely-populated island. That means the cost of a 10-year ownership permit \u2014 the car isn\u2019t included \u2014 is equivalent to 92 per cent of the nation\u2019s median annual household income. The latest figures come despite government hikes on additional registration fees for cars valued at over S$40,000, a move expected to generate an additional S$200 million in the coming budget year while impacting the top one-third of newly registered cars by market value. The higher government-imposed fee follows an influx of new wealth from places including Hong Kong, mainland China and India after Singapore became one of the first Asian financial centres to successfully emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. But the latest bidding round shows that the higher tax isn\u2019t having much impact. Despite a widely lauded public transit system, in which a bus or subway ride can cost less than S$1, there will always be people in this city of 5.6 million who still want to own a private vehicle \u2014 or maybe more than one \u2014 and can afford to pay, said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking. The pricey ownership rights are the result of a quota system that controls the number of autos allowed on the nation\u2019s streets, helping limit congestion and pollution, through the twice-a-month bidding process. Bid successfully and your shiny new Mercedes-Benz becomes road-worthy. When the overall quota of permits was reduced by 14 per cent and premiums skyrocketed to a then-record high in November last year, luxury models benefited the most, with Mercedes vehicles surpassing Toyota models as the top auto brand registered. In fact, in recent months one in every four cars registered was either a Mercedes-Benz or BMW. Rising prices have also been driven by a growing appetite for electric and hybrid models, which have accounted for more than half of new purchases so far this year. In Singapore, owning a car such as a Tesla Model 3 Performance could quickly surpass US$200,000, depending on the vehicle\u2019s features and the price paid for the permit. For Singaporeans who just want an ordinary vehicle to get to their office or a weekend movie, the hope is that the supply of 10-year entitlements begins to stabilise, a shift that is expected after an adjustment the government\u2019s Land Transport Authority recently made. But for the time being, costs are still trending up. And if you need a car now, the next auction takes place Apr 5.

It is a verbal agreement by the bank, showing the amount they are potentially prepared to lend to you, based on your financial ability and the credit history. It is not a gurantee, but it do help customer to gauge the range that the bank is able to finance them and to choose a property of that range. 2) Does all bank give the same amount for AIP/IPA? No, different bank set different criteria. It varies throughout the banks. 3) What is the difference between Repricing and refinancing? Repricing mainly is to negotiate a better rate within the same bank while refinancing is to switch a bank for a better rate 4) What is the difference between going straight to the bank and getting a mortgage broker to serve me? There are more than 10 banks / Financial Institute in Singapore, 0.10% - 0.2% makes  a difference on the interest you paid yearly. If Bank A only sell Sibor package, Banker A will tell you that Sibor Package is best and others cant fight them . For Mortgage Broker, we consolidate rates from almost all banks in Singapore , source the best rate for you and tailor it to suits your risk level. Moreover, we do quaterly / half yearly review on customer package to determine if they require a switch of bank. 5) Do we have to pay mortgage broker for their service? Most bank renumerate brokers for their service and normally broker service are FREE (unless otherwise stated) 6) Since the bank is paying Mortgage Broker , will Mortgage Broker still source us the Best rate in the Market? Mortgage Broker are renumerate based on a percentage of the loan, getting you the best package wont affect their commission, so in order to get more repeat customer and referrals, Mortgage Broker will source you the best rates, based on your risk taking level. 6) What are the basic documentation required for a financing of property?

Late last year, the 25-year-old decided it was time to give up on his job search after he failed to receive any responses. He decided he would resume his search for a full-time position when the economy improves and joined his friends and started an F&B business. Mr Haziq is part of a growing number of discouraged workers here aged under 30. This year, there were 1,200 young discouraged workers, up from 700 last year. A discouraged worker is someone who is not actively looking for a job because he or she does not think that a search will yield results. When the prevailing outlook in the economy is gloomy and there is a shortage of jobs, the incidence of discouraged workers tends to increase. This year, there were 9,900 discouraged workers, up from 8,700 last year but lower than the 11,100 in 2009. According to the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) advance release on the labour force two weeks ago, 6,900 of discouraged workers - nearly 70 per cent - were aged above 50. The under 30s were the second largest group at 12 per cent. The MOM report cited some reasons for workers being discouraged - the belief that there is no suitable work available, employers' discrimination or the lack of necessary qualifications, training or experience. National University of Singapore (NUS) labour economist Liu Hao Ming says it is hard to guess if young discouraged workers here are highly educated. He said: ""By definition, these individuals believe that they cannot find a job at the wage rate that is at or above their reservation wages (lowest wage rate at which a worker is willing to accept a particular type of job). ""It... is a mix of expectation of acceptable wages and probability of finding such jobs."" Mr Haziq admits that his chances of employment could have been limited because he insisted on getting a job in the creative industry. Eventually, worry over his finances led him to set up SteamHaus with his friends. SteamHaus sells steamed buns at events and has been quite successful so far. He said: ""I think I would be a lot more stressed if the business was going badly. I saved quite a bit during National Service and from my freelance jobs, but I was worried this would dry up."" NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser thinks that the number of young discouraged workers could rise if there continues to be a mismatch of skills and expectations between job seekers and employers. He said: ""Our young people have been brought up to believe in the Singapore Dream - they want to be able to purchase a flat, settle down and enjoy a decent standard of living. If their job prospects do not support that kind of aspirations, they would be rather discouraged.""",2019-05-07T20:44:41,less educated

Failure rate always around 20% (about 4 to 5 person) per cohort. Click to expand... 2) Kyoji83 said: Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for Registered Nurses is a 2 years Full Time course for Singaporean & PR to be bond them for 3 years as Registered Nurse upon graduating from Diploma(Nursing). You will only see the Contract after signing Letter of Undertaking for $1K of Liquidated Damages (LD)if you decided not to take up PCP sponsorship after NYP offer you a seat. ----------------------------------------------------------- This is the estimated Estimated amount of liquidated damages upon signing deed (Training allowance is $1,900 per month upon signing deed) 1st year = (Course Fees for 1st year + Training Allowance for 1st year + $150.00 uniform) x 110% = ($39,782.60# + $22,800.00 + $150.00) x 110% = $69,005.86 2nd year = (LD of first (1st) year + Course Fees for 2nd year + Training Allowance for 2nd year (to 5th year) + One-Time Career Transition Bonus) x 110% = ($69,005.86 + $39,782.60# + $22,800.00 + $2,000.00) x 110% = $146,947.31 However there is an increment of allowance from $1,900 to $2,050. So now the new estimated amount of liquidated damages is: 1st year = (Course Fees for 1st year + Training Allowance for 1st year + $150.00 uniform) x 110% \t= ($39,782.60# + $24,600.00 + $150.00) x 110% = $70,985.86 2nd year = (LD of first (1st) year + Course Fees for 2nd year + Training Allowance for 2nd year (to 5th year)\t+ One-Time Career Transition Bonus) x 110% = ($70,985.86+ $39,782.60# + $24,600.00 + $2,000.00) x 110% = $151,105.31 * Remark: Depending on sponsoring hospital, some will included medical checkup & injection fees for DL. For this computation of LD is without it. ----------------------------------------------------------- Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) stated that total liquidated damages (including full course fees, training allowances and career transition bonus) at the point of training completion could amount to roughly be $125,000 which is not the true facts! I suspected that NYP give to WDA, Ministry of Health (MOH), MOH Holdings (MOHH) and sponsoring hospitals a estimated course fees of $39,782.60 per year to draft sponsorship contract. After NYP decided to charge $34,475.40 that year without allowing student to have Subsidy like MOE*Tuition*Grant to  sponsoring hospital. Normally, a seller will give a price for the product to be consider by the buyer. However I am surprise why this work another way when the buyers (WDA, MOH, MOHH and sponsoring hospitals) willing to buy the product before the seller (NYP) even give the actual price. During that year, Full time 3 years normal Diploma courses for Singaporean is $19,881.60, PR is $22,695.70 & International Students is $26,218.70 as Non*subsidised*Student for that year. So why did NYP charge a high price of $34,475.40 or unacceptable purchasing procedures without anyone like Auditor General's Office (AGO) questioning? To add on, why Singaporeans & PRs are not given Tuition Grant for studying full-time Diploma in Nursing (PCP)? ----------------------------------------------------------- I have actually ask FTs who are under sponsorship for 3 years normal Diploma courses & their reply is they do not know their actual amount for LD. Their surety are FTs who mostly like their parent in their home country like China. If they run away, by right Singapore Government (sponsors) needs to engage Lawyer at China to demand for DL payment. However I never hear any sponsors doing that. For PCP, there is no way to run cause both student & surety are local.

Same route of advancement as normal diploma holders but high expectation because we are mid-career switch.

PCP student trained in only Nursing Lab 1A but attended Clinical Placement 1A & partial 1B in semester 1. In short, PCP student are assess in Clinical Placement when they are not trained but during pre-Clinical Placement briefing, student are told not to perform skills if you are not trained. 5) It is up to Assessor to ask any questions (could be from other modules like Human Bioscience) for Nursing Lab test that is not taught in Nursing Lab by Lecturers and not shown in course materials. 6) Full time student have around 40 students in a class while my PCP class have only 25 students. During Nursing Lab Test, Assessor tend to give more chance to full time students by clearing them faster such asking easiler or less questions & move on if student unable to answer. 7) If Lecturers want to play you out, they will not be consistent with course materials by omitting or adding non-relevant information, procedure not in sequence & etc to your practicing/sub-group in Nursing Lab Test. 8) A Nursing Lab Test maybe 1 hour test with 2 skills (about 30 minutes per skill). Assessor can play you out by starting the test time but stop you from doing the skills until you answer all Assessor's questions in order to be 'safe' that can last up to 30 minutes or more which mean you will know that you will fail the test at that time. 9) When NYP Lecturers feel that you cannot perform, some of them will start to tort you by verbal and emotional abuse to affect your mental health. They will keep harassing you by stressing the increasing huge amount of liquidated damages when you stay longer in a course and keep asking you when you intend to quit.

That is the time where commander will consider to schedule ICT for NSmen reservist. However for PCP student, we start 2 weeks earlier compare to Full time student. We only have 2 weeks school holiday after our Clinical Placement which is the end of semester. So NSmen will have problem for their ICT cause NYP only give you deferment letter but it is up to your NS unit to approve the deferment. My classmates & my seniors were lucky to be SPF NSmen. They will received their estimated ICT schedule long before they received their NP76 for SPF NSmen (SAF100 for SAF & SCDF100 for SCDF NSmen). So they can make arrangement to reschedule their ICT during school holiday for PCP student. So for those who want to sign up for PCP, better think twice because reservist is a liability for PCP student & you do not want this to be the cause of your liquidated damages.

So my dad fell a few years back - it was a really bad fall with head fracture that led to a stroke. He got out of a coma but never regained full consciousness, which means he totally can't communicate and we're also unsure if he actually knows what's going on. He is also completely immobile. According to the neurologist my dad is only semi-conscious. At the hospital the social worker suggested a nursing home but we couldn't bear to have our dad anywhere else but with us, so it's been awhile now and we're now like a well-oiled machine with ammos in place to take care of our dad e.g. a hoist to lift him up onto a wheelchair from the bed, and vice-versa. It's a very tough, not because it's xin ku, but because it's heartbreaking to see someone you love so much end up in this state. But we try to make everyday a good day for him and for us.

The owners of the development\u2019s 710 sq ft units stand to get $1.22 million each, while owners of the 2,045 sq ft units may receive as much as $2.66 million each, according to a July 13 letter from the Chuan Park collective sales committee (CSC) to owners seen by The Straits Times. As at Sept 4, 579 owners making up 81.33 per cent of total share values and 80.39 per cent of the total area of all lots in Chuan Park have signed the collective sale agreement. The collective sale tender closes on Nov 18 at 3.30 pm. Chuan Park failed in its 2018 sale bid with a guide price of $900 million, and subsequently lowered the price to $820 million. \u201cSince launching the first EOGM (extraordinary general meeting) in early October 2019, the CSC has diligently tracked land sales indexes as well as property market developments, and where the market has moved upwards, we have done research to ensure a suitable response to these changes,\u201d the Chuan Park CSC said in the July 13 letter. \u201cAs such you have seen us moving the reserve price from the initial $820 million to $850 million and in early May (back) to $900 million,\u201d it added. But the CSC has further raised the guide price to $938 million \u201cas this is sustainable and still within the tolerance threshold of developers, given our location and the current market conditions\u201d. \u201cThe most recent government land sales exercise has been extremely encouraging, particularly in the case of the Ang Mo Kio residential site, which concluded at $1,118 psf ppr (per square foot per plot ratio), a result exceeding any previous awards where pricing for out-of-city centre plots generally stayed below the $1,000 psf mark,\u201d the CSC said. The 37,216 sq m site has a gross plot ratio of 2.1, with an achievable proposed gross floor area (GFA) of 78,153 sq m. The site, which is located near Lorong Chuan MRT, can be redeveloped into 900 to 919 units. With no development charge payable, the land cost works out to about $1,042 psf ppr, after factoring in the 7 per cent bonus GFA, according to marketing agent ERA. Collective sale activity among private residential condominiums has been heating up this year, with Braddell View set to convene an EOGM on Oct 8 to form its collective sale committee for its second attempt. The 920-unit Braddell View, which was privatised from Singapore\u2019s last and biggest privatised Housing and Urban Development Company estate, failed in its initial collective sale bid as there were no bidders for the mega site at $2.08 billion, or a land rate of $1,199 psf ppr. Meanwhile, the 596-unit, 999-year Cashew Heights condominium in Upper Bukit Timah is now trying to get an 80 per cent mandate to launch a collective sale at $1.9 billion after its attempt in 2018 at $1.88 billion failed. Owners stand to get between $2.8 million and $3.29 million each depending on the size of their units, according to an Aug 12 document showing the apportionment of sale proceeds based on the $1.9 billion reserve price.

A local survey published last month found that the median gross monthly salary of last year's graduates had shot up from S$3,800 in 2021 to S$4,200 (US$2,860 to US$3,160). This was a sharp spike compared with previous years, where median salaries for fresh graduates typically increased by S$100 each year. One mechanical engineering graduate, who took up an operations role in the automotive industry, told CNA that his starting pay was S$3,500 \u2013 well below last year's median salary of S$4,600 for those in the engineering cluster. The 26-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Lewis, graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in May last year. His current job was one of three offers he received within a month of applying for jobs after graduating in May last year. The other two had offered a slightly higher pay of S$3,600 but he eventually settled for his current role due to the company\u2019s reputation and the prospect of receiving bonus payouts of up to six months. Based on his knowledge of the company's typical salary increments, he estimated that his salary would increase by about 5 per cent following his performance appraisal. While this will bump his salary up to S$3,675, it would still be lower than last year\u2019s median pay for his sector. \u201cI do feel a bit left out,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut at this juncture of my career, I\u2019m still very much learning and so my focus isn\u2019t really about how much I\u2019m making, but rather the exposure and experience I\u2019m getting."" Another fresh graduate, who received his degree in information systems from the National University of Singapore (NUS) last May, was offered S$5,200 for a software developer role. The 27-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Keith, successfully negotiated a higher pay of S$5,500. Despite this, his salary is still lower than the median starting pay of S$5,625 for those in the information and digital technologies cluster. But not all graduates from the Class of 2022 have managed to land a job. Another NUS graduate, who received her degree in psychology with a minor in communications and new media in December, is still unemployed and on the search for a full-time job. The 24-year-old, who wanted to be known as Eunice, told CNA she applied for 60 to 70 jobs in various industries since the start of the year but few have responded. \u201cI\u2019m casting my net wide and applying for roles that seem interesting to me, so I have been looking at entry-level and associate roles that suit my skills or are in companies that I really like,\u201d she said.

Let me start with my own personal opinion about how the Singapore education system can be improved: To change to skills based, from the current talking based, * Scrap away humanities subjects: social studies, geography, history, literature. Keep only english to recognize that the situational writing and english language paper 2 are enough to train and test and prepare students for the world, in terms of talking. * Add in religion studies, to take the place of humanities, and also to replace the Civics and Moral Education. This will ensure that the students are equipped with moral values, upon completing the 10 years of compulsory education at 16 years old. Religious studies should be compulsory, and be one of the O level examination subjects. * Secondary time, the secondary school should use AI to help every student identify what are their strengths, based on their academic performance in secondary one and secondary two. It can be a simple listing down of all the final results of the subjects that they have tested in secondary one and secondary two, and ranking them from the best to the worst. Then, offer a suitable subject combination. Currently, the freedom to choose, a bit too headless chicken already. Children only 14 years old, they know how to make wise decision meh? Should actually use AI, as mentioned above, to help them make the right decision. Okay, the secondary 2 streaming quite important, as it will influence the later part: tertiary and university. * Tertiary: this is when a lot of people will waste their time. However, it can be mitigated, if the right decision is made at secondary 2 streaming. * Tertiary and University: learn from Hong Kong, merge the local polytechnics and universities into Polytechnic Universities. This recommendation, to have Polytechnic Universities, will help to lower the age of Singaporeans entering the society to work full-time in their professional career. Currently, Singaporean Males only enter the society to work full-time at the age of 25 to 27. Girls probably around 23 years old. Entering earlier can improve our Singaporeans' competitiveness. If merge Poly and Uni together, * It will be 100% in that profession; no language module or whatever physical education module. * Can potentially reduce the learning to just 3 to 4 years, thereby increasing the Returns on Investment, and reducing the time and other resources required. * After 1 year into 100% learning that profession, those students who cannot make it one, should be forced to change profession; boys should be forced to enlist national service first, when they are more mature in their learning then return to school to learn another profession that is more suitable for them. That said, ITE and JC should be scrapped. Everyone all go through the Polytechnic University route. Good idea hor? Not only would it make it a level playing field for every Singaporean, It will save a considerable amount of time and other resources, and Singaporeans would be able to enter the society to work full-time at a younger age and at a more competitive level, Thereby having more ability to excel in the Singapore economy, and the global economy. The above are my opinions. Can't believe from a small seed can evolve into one big tree that encompasses the Singapore education system from secondary to the time when Singaporeans actually enter the society to work full-time in their professional career. In the following weeks, due to the Mercury and Jupiter Conjunction, this is when there will be people talking about their aspirations for the future, at the same time there will also be people who will be expressing their pessimism about matters. Therefore, now may be a good time to really talk about how we can really improve the Singapore education system, rather than just have a casual conversation about it every Sunday. Let's have a fruitful discussion about how we can improve the Singapore education system.",2023-02-26T15:38:06,elite education

Japan recorded fewer than 800,000 births last year, the lowest in the country of 125 million since records began. The prime minister has warned the trend threatens ""whether we can continue to function as a society"", and fresh focus on the issue has sparked countless articles. But one in particular, noting Japan has the highest ratio in the OECD of women aged 50 who have never had children, triggered an outpouring of responses using the hashtag ""life-long childlessness"". Tomoko Okada had long felt ""ashamed"" about not having children and hesitated to click on the trending topic on Twitter initially, fearing the usual barrage of criticism. Instead, she found mostly sympathetic and nuanced discussions, with women explaining why they had been unable to start a family or, in some cases, why they had chosen not to. ""I used to strongly believe that giving birth was the 'normal' thing to do,"" the 47-year-old freelance writer told AFP. She tried matchmaking services hoping to find a partner, with no luck, and was left feeling guilty when her dad asked for a grandchild for Father's Day. But posting her experiences and reading those of others helped her feel ""my way of life is also OK"". ""SO MUCH CRITICISM""\u200b While many developed countries are struggling with low birth rates, the problem is particularly acute in Japan. It has the world's second-oldest population after Monaco, and its relatively strict immigration rules mean it faces growing labour shortages. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed policies including financial aid for families, easier childcare access and more parental leave. But with female lawmakers accounting for fewer than 10 per cent of Japan's powerful lower house, and Kishida's 19-minister cabinet including just two women, most of those involved in the debate are men. That has left some women feeling sidelined, or even under attack. \u200b ""Don't blame women for the low birth rate,"" tweeted Ayako, a 38-year-old Tokyo resident without children, who used the hashtag to call for recognition of ""various choices"" in life. She told AFP that Japan's traditional gender roles are central to the problem. A 2021 government survey found that Japanese women spend around four times as long on chores and childcare as men, even with more husbands working from home. Ayako is outspoken online, but said she finds herself ""shunned"" when she speaks about gender-related issues in real life, and preferred not to give her surname. ""It's hard to raise your voice in the real world. I feel like women receive so much criticism just for expressing their opinions,"" she said. On social media, however, ""I'm often surprised to find other people with the same views."" ""ECHO CHAMBERS""\u200b Yuiko Fujita, a media and gender studies professor at Meiji University, said social media has become a way for women in particular to discuss political and societal issues with less fear, often anonymously. Other birthrate-related hashtags, railing against mothers being ""single-operator childcare services"" or lamenting rejected nursery applications, have also gone viral. But the outpouring has limited impact outside the ""echo chambers"" online, warned Fujita. ""Unfortunately ... not many of these voices make it beyond the community of women to reach the political arena."" Experts believe the declining birth rate is a complex problem with numerous roots. Just 2.4 per cent of births in Japan are outside of marriage, the lowest among the OECD group of 38 countries - a figure often attributed to conservative norms and financial structures that favour families. Some point to economics, arguing the country's long-stagnant growth discourages couples from having babies. Policy changes such as expanding daycare provision can help boost birth rates, but the increase is often ""temporary"", said Takumi Fujinami of the Japan Research Institute. As well as equality when it comes to household chores, he said, ""long-term economic stability and rising incomes are key.""",2023-03-28T12:28:28,access to education

This new requirement, which also applies to domestic helpers, is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses as medical costs rise, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday, highlighting that more than 5 per cent of foreign workers\u2019 medical bills exceed the current $15,000 coverage limit. An average of more than 1,000 employers a year face this issue, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament in March 2022, when he announced the move for additional insurance coverage. MOM estimates that more than 99 per cent of bills for hospitalisation and surgical procedures will fall within the new coverage limit. Under the new rules, employers also have to co-pay 25 per cent of claim amounts that go above the first $15,000. This means that if a worker incurs a $60,000 bill for heart surgery, for instance, the employer will have to pay $11,250, which is 25 per cent of $45,000. The insurer will cover the other $48,750. From July 2025, several other changes will also be implemented. Employers will no longer need to pay for their workers\u2019 medical treatment upfront and claim the amount from insurers later. Insurers will be required to reimburse hospitals directly. There will also be a standard list of allowable exclusions for insurers, such as procedures that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery. Insurers will not have to cover the treatments for pre-existing illnesses occurring within the first 12 months of work under the same employer. Insurers must also offer different premiums for workers aged 50 and below, and those above the age of 50, from July 2025. There were 1,033,500 work permit holders \u2013 of whom 268,500 were maids \u2013 and 177,900 S Pass holders working in Singapore as at the end of last year. Medical bills of migrant workers are not subsidised or covered under national schemes such as MediShield Life and MediFund. MOM said the policy changes are being implemented in phases to give employers and insurers time to adjust to the cost impact. The ministry added: \u201cWith many insurers expressing interest to offer the enhanced medical insurance products, the market will be competitive and employers will have a range of insurers to choose from.\u201d Employers must provide medical insurance coverage of at least $60,000 for maids, migrant workers from July This is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses, said MOM.

I think the idea behind this scheme is not bad as being severly disabled, we really need large sum of money to get by. However, we already have so many types of insurance that we have to pay for and we are not sure in the future, there are any more new insurance scheme out there or increase in premiums of any existing insurance scheme. It is good that the supplement can be paid partially by Medisave, we still need Medisave to pay for Medishield, the basic Careshield Life and Dependants Protection Scheme, and MEdishield and Careshield Life will get more expensive as one ages.

Skilled foreign employees can help strengthen local workforce, transfer expertise: Tan See Leng While the job market is looking up, Dr Tan has cautioned that the nation needs to strengthen its local workforce and be better prepared for global headwinds. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: While Singapore\u2019s job market is looking up, with robust employment numbers and strong wage growth , Manpower Minister Tan See Leng cautioned that the nation needs to strengthen its local workforce and be better prepared for global headwinds. \u201cWe had a good run last year. But there are headwinds that are actually not in the distant horizon, they are quite near, with all the global uncertainties and volatilities,\u201d Dr Tan said on Wednesday (Mar 1). \u201cThis is the best time \u2013 while we are on a bit of a roll \u2013 to seize whatever opportunities that can come our way and make sure that we are better prepared. \u201cWe need to continue to strengthen the entire local workforce, and help to secure safer, progressive, more inclusive workplaces to ensure that all Singaporeans have fair and equitable work.\u201d Job numbers have seen a stellar rebound since the COVID-19 pandemic, easing of restrictions, and recovery of sectors. Total employment grew for five straight quarters and ended 2022 with a record 231,700 jobs, surpassing its pre-pandemic level by 3 per cent, said the Manpower Ministry (MOM). Dr Tan, who is also Second Minister for Trade and Industry, said that forward-looking policies enabled the good results last year. LEARNING FROM FOREIGN CO-WORKERS\u200b Moving forward, one focus would be to ensure that local workers can learn valuable expertise from their highly-skilled foreign colleagues. The new Manpower for Strategic Economic Priorities (M-SEP) scheme launched last December allows firms that have expansion plans to temporarily bring in more foreign hires above the quota for their industry. \u201cWe want to ensure that the talent that we bring in are at (a certain) level, to be able to not just become rainmakers, but they also have the skill sets and tech expertise, to transfer to or teach our own local graduates, our own local talent as well,\u201d Dr Tan told CNA\u2019s Singapore Tonight. \u201cThe skills that they bring in can be complementary to our local workforce. And together, it becomes a win-win partnership, we can then forge and form the best teams to go out and compete globally.\u201d Dr Tan added that as Singapore is a small nation with population constraints, local employees need to \u201cwork with the best and collectively leverage each other's strengths \u2026 to stay in the top league\u201d. \u2018LEVEL UP\u2019 THE LOCAL WORKFORCE\u200b With constant upgrades in relevant skills and shifting trends in the job market, such as the rapid digitisation of many industries, Singaporeans need to stay up to date and adapt to change, said Dr Tan. \u201cBecause of accelerating changes happening around the world, all the disruptions happening in the tech industry, financial services, as well as in healthcare, we need to make sure that we keep constantly abreast and ahead of these changes,\u201d he said. The Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS), which will start in September, is a foreign workforce policy that will allow firms to bring in overseas workers for roles that are short in supply of Singaporeans. These foreign employees can support the development of the local talent pool and \u201chelp to level up our own people\u201d, said Dr Tan. In addition, the Government has also invested significantly in initiatives to help the local workforce upskill and stay relevant, he said. For instance, Workforce Singapore\u2019s (WSG) Career Conversion Programme helps mid-career workers undergo skills conversion to equip them with expertise for new roles or sectors, and can give participants an edge when it comes to career progression. \u200b",2023-03-02T16:31:42,professional conversion programme

I use to do all the room rentals  and most of the maintenance work myself but these days i am going to be based overseas. I have an agent that handles the room rentals but the issue is that one of the houses generates alot of maintenance issues and every time i am away issues seem to crop up. lve had pipes burst in the wall, leaks from the apartment above, aircons drain pipes clogging, now windows leaking, kitchen cabinets fall apart on me and the list goes on. Tenant changeovers also are a hassle as the agent doesn't seem to spot maintenance issues or damages that the moving out tenant causes and i end up having to absorb the damage. Invariable the bed needs to be changed out or the the curtains or the walls painted and if lm not around things dont seem to get done. My agent does a good job in finding tenants just not the post care followup and i don't blame her as the rental commission is peanuts to her. So far i have had to step in to fix up all these problems as the agent is slow to respond and simply doesn't have the time to manage all these issues. lm starting to think about how to change the business model and outsource the property to a firm that specializes in property management and accept a lower return but after seeing all the bad reviews about how they neglect the properties and sweep maintenance issues under the table i am torn about what to do. I have about 8 rooms to rent spread across two properties. I was considering simply a property management firm to address the maintenance issues but so far even the firm that operates in my own condo their horrendous and inept. i have considered renting out the whole house but in my area that is rather risky as its geylang and i am worried about it getting subletted and used for nefarious activities. Also it would kick the can down the road as most tenants would sweep the maintenance issues under the rug and upon handover the house would have significantly degraded. I dont have the scale to hire someone full time to manage these properties as the scale is just too small. Any advise would be helpful on what to do in this situation.

The net result is that locals can take on the jobs at \u201cslightly higher levels\u201d , Dr Tan said, citing findings from internal studies by his ministry on foreign workforce policies. \u201cThis has therefore informed our approach of remaining open to high quality foreign professionals while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of Work Permit holders through quotas and also levies,\u201d he said. However, there is a limit to how much the government can tighten access to lower-skilled foreign workers, due to the size of Singapore\u2019s population, Dr Tan pointed out. Continuing to do so would have a \u201cworse-off\u201d effect on Singapore\u2019s economic progress and industry development, he added. Noting that the same correlation of tightening foreign worker access and improving local employment does not apply at higher skill levels, Perera asked if this meant that Singapore is not producing enough highly skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating. Disagreeing, Dr Tan said: \u201cWe are already doing significantly more to improve on the prospects in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, in the upskilling, in upgrading.\u201d But accelerating changes have forced economies and industries to evolve rapidly, alongside other significant disruptions, he said. \u201cTo keep pace with those and to keep ahead pre-emptively, in terms of making sure that we\u2019re ahead of the competition, we will not just need to develop our own local talent, we will also need foreign workers to come alongside with us and complement us as we move forward.\u201d Dr Tan noted however that the studies \u201care but just one input to the entire policymaking process\u201d, adding that they have their limitations. \u201cFor example, they are unable to account for less quantifiable effects of having foreigners in our workplace and our workforce, such as the knowledge spillovers to locals and other network effects,\u201d he said. This means the impact of the interventions studied might also change if they are applied beyond a certain scale or at a different time period.

She made this call before an audience of around 80 scouts as she launched the Scout Association\u2019s 2023 Diamond Jubilee Challenge, which focuses on the environment this year. The youth-led initiative, which is in its second year, will end in 2025 in conjunction with Singapore\u2019s 60 years of nationhood. By then, more than 12,500 scouts will be ready to achieve the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, which have been incorporated into the challenge. Ms Fu said: \u201cWhen we collectively adopt sustainable habits, such as bringing our own bags and containers, conserving electricity and water, and taking public transport, it can help reduce our national carbon footprint. \u201cIndividual actions can even influence companies. If we demand products with less packaging or choose energy-efficient appliances, companies will start to adopt greener and more sustainable products and solutions.\u201d In a dialogue with the scouts at the event, Ms Fu noted that the challenge is timely, with Singapore in 2022 raising its climate ambition to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. As part of this year\u2019s challenge, scouts will embark on learning journeys or community activities related to the environment in every quarter. In support of the Steward Pillar of the year-long Forward Singapore exercise, the scouts will also be submitting a Green Nation Pledge to commit to making Singapore a green, liveable and climate-resilient nation. Among those participating in the challenge is Ngee Ann Polytechnic student Elvin Kong, who hopes to make thrifting - the act of shopping second-hand - a culture in his school and for other scouts. The final-year automation and mechatronic systems student said: \u201cIn polytechnic, we tend to have to dress up when we come to school so a lot of us have to go out and buy shirts. \u201cBut some of my schoolmates and I realised last year that maybe this trend will lead to us throwing a lot of shirts away so with thrifting becoming more common, I think schools can promote these initiatives.\u201d In the next few months, Mr Kong and a few of his peers will be organising an exchange for his peers to trade clothes, he said. The 20-year-old also hopes to hold a similar activity for scouts to recycle their uniforms. Meanwhile, fellow scout Mellina Mohamad Noor, 21, is planning to take bigger steps towards encouraging others to cut down on food waste, a cause that struck her during a trip to rural areas in Vietnam as a secondary school student. The second-year Ngee Ann Polytechnic early childhood development and education student said: \u201cMost of the scout students only know that we throw a lot of trash but they do not know what kind of trash is being thrown.\u201d \u201cSo when I introduce the topic of food waste, they realise that we shouldn\u2019t waste food, that we should only buy what we can finish.\u201d",2023-01-14T22:16:09,central provident fund

But Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Saturday challenged Singaporeans to go beyond excellent Pisa scores and grade performance towards a meritocracy of skills, where regardless of where they start in life, everyone is given the chance to fulfil their potential. \u201cHow can we be an exemplar to the world, a nation that celebrates diverse pathways of success and combines meritocracy with compassion, inclusion, and responsibility?\u201d he said. Mr Chan was addressing some 300 students at The Straits Times Education Forum held in partnership with the Singapore Management University (SMU) on the role higher education plays in building a sustainable and resilient future. Another 30 students attended the event virtually. In his keynote speech, Mr Chan said institutes of higher learning (IHLs) play a key role in building a meritocracy of skills through aptitude-based admissions and by providing different entry points and pathways for lifelong learning. Beyond providing mass access to education, IHLs also need to tailor curricula to meet individuals\u2019 different needs and strengths, he added. \u201cIHLs are already moving in this direction by offering options to customise degree programmes, and expanding the range of modular courses for adult learners to customise their learning based on their needs,\u201d he said.

They were speaking to The Straits Times on 2022 household income figures released by the Singapore Department of Statistics (SingStat) on Thursday. Median monthly household income from work rose 0.2 per cent in real terms, or after adjusting for inflation, in 2022. This is lower than the 1.5 per cent increase registered in 2021. After adjusting for inflation, households in the first nine deciles saw real income growth. Only the top decile saw a drop in real income. Asked why this is so, analysts said the highest income group could be most affected by high inflation, as they spend more on big-ticket items such as cars, air tickets and private properties. Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the National University of Singapore Business School\u2019s Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said top income earners are usually professionals whose incomes are subject to variations due to the economic situation, which has not been favourable in recent years. \u201cIt is normally more difficult to sustain the high bases in income as one goes up the earnings ladder,\u201d he added. Experts said cost of living remains a concern, especially for middle-income households. The fall in income inequality, they added, showed that Government measures to uplift the lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Model and Workfare Income Supplement scheme have been effective. Income inequality is also moderated by government transfers. Government job and wage support schemes during the pandemic allowed lower income earners to maintain their pay or even keep their jobs, said Prof Loh. After adjusting for government transfers and taxes, the Gini coefficient in 2022 fell from 0.437 to 0.378. This compares favourably with some developing nations, which have a Gini coefficient of around 0.6, said NUS sociology professor Tan Ern Ser. But a look at wealth inequality may present a different picture, he added. Wealthier individuals may have income from sources other than employment, such as investments, property and inherited wealth, which are not accounted for in SingStat data. CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the increase in real household incomes showed that the post-Covid-19 re-opening of the economy has created more opportunities, with the labour market tightening significantly. To further narrow the income gap in the long run, higher wages and quality jobs would help the lowest earners. He said that while inflation remains high, it may have peaked in 2022. \u201cInflation becomes a concern only when it becomes entrenched, and expectations for inflation continue to rise and outstrip nominal wage growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do see this... where we have supply disruptions and various issues like the Ukraine war, but it looks like the worst of inflation may be behind us.\u201d OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said: \u201cInflation may not ease significantly this year, at least not in the first half of the year, especially for core inflation, so both nominal and real wage income growth may remain muted. \u201cFor households, especially middle income ones, they will likely still feel the pain from being squeezed by higher prices for most goods and services, as well as higher debt servicing burdens due to rising interest rates.\u201d She added that nominal wage growth may not keep pace with inflation in 2023, with headline and core inflation likely to come in at around 6 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. But, she observed, unemployment rates are very low and employment gains jumped in 2022.

A local survey published last month found that the median gross monthly salary of last year's graduates had shot up from S$3,800 in 2021 to S$4,200 (US$2,860 to US$3,160). This was a sharp spike compared with previous years, where median salaries for fresh graduates typically increased by S$100 each year. One mechanical engineering graduate, who took up an operations role in the automotive industry, told CNA that his starting pay was S$3,500 \u2013 well below last year's median salary of S$4,600 for those in the engineering cluster. The 26-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Lewis, graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in May last year. His current job was one of three offers he received within a month of applying for jobs after graduating in May last year. The other two had offered a slightly higher pay of S$3,600 but he eventually settled for his current role due to the company\u2019s reputation and the prospect of receiving bonus payouts of up to six months. Based on his knowledge of the company's typical salary increments, he estimated that his salary would increase by about 5 per cent following his performance appraisal. While this will bump his salary up to S$3,675, it would still be lower than last year\u2019s median pay for his sector. \u201cI do feel a bit left out,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut at this juncture of my career, I\u2019m still very much learning and so my focus isn\u2019t really about how much I\u2019m making, but rather the exposure and experience I\u2019m getting."" Another fresh graduate, who received his degree in information systems from the National University of Singapore (NUS) last May, was offered S$5,200 for a software developer role. The 27-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Keith, successfully negotiated a higher pay of S$5,500. Despite this, his salary is still lower than the median starting pay of S$5,625 for those in the information and digital technologies cluster. But not all graduates from the Class of 2022 have managed to land a job. Another NUS graduate, who received her degree in psychology with a minor in communications and new media in December, is still unemployed and on the search for a full-time job. The 24-year-old, who wanted to be known as Eunice, told CNA she applied for 60 to 70 jobs in various industries since the start of the year but few have responded. \u201cI\u2019m casting my net wide and applying for roles that seem interesting to me, so I have been looking at entry-level and associate roles that suit my skills or are in companies that I really like,\u201d she said.

She made this call before an audience of around 80 scouts as she launched the Scout Association\u2019s 2023 Diamond Jubilee Challenge, which focuses on the environment this year. The youth-led initiative, which is in its second year, will end in 2025 in conjunction with Singapore\u2019s 60 years of nationhood. By then, more than 12,500 scouts will be ready to achieve the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, which have been incorporated into the challenge. Ms Fu said: \u201cWhen we collectively adopt sustainable habits, such as bringing our own bags and containers, conserving electricity and water, and taking public transport, it can help reduce our national carbon footprint. \u201cIndividual actions can even influence companies. If we demand products with less packaging or choose energy-efficient appliances, companies will start to adopt greener and more sustainable products and solutions.\u201d In a dialogue with the scouts at the event, Ms Fu noted that the challenge is timely, with Singapore in 2022 raising its climate ambition to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. As part of this year\u2019s challenge, scouts will embark on learning journeys or community activities related to the environment in every quarter. In support of the Steward Pillar of the year-long Forward Singapore exercise, the scouts will also be submitting a Green Nation Pledge to commit to making Singapore a green, liveable and climate-resilient nation. Among those participating in the challenge is Ngee Ann Polytechnic student Elvin Kong, who hopes to make thrifting - the act of shopping second-hand - a culture in his school and for other scouts. The final-year automation and mechatronic systems student said: \u201cIn polytechnic, we tend to have to dress up when we come to school so a lot of us have to go out and buy shirts. \u201cBut some of my schoolmates and I realised last year that maybe this trend will lead to us throwing a lot of shirts away so with thrifting becoming more common, I think schools can promote these initiatives.\u201d In the next few months, Mr Kong and a few of his peers will be organising an exchange for his peers to trade clothes, he said. The 20-year-old also hopes to hold a similar activity for scouts to recycle their uniforms. Meanwhile, fellow scout Mellina Mohamad Noor, 21, is planning to take bigger steps towards encouraging others to cut down on food waste, a cause that struck her during a trip to rural areas in Vietnam as a secondary school student. The second-year Ngee Ann Polytechnic early childhood development and education student said: \u201cMost of the scout students only know that we throw a lot of trash but they do not know what kind of trash is being thrown.\u201d \u201cSo when I introduce the topic of food waste, they realise that we shouldn\u2019t waste food, that we should only buy what we can finish.\u201d",2023-01-14T22:16:09,middle income

The unnamed man, who worked as a plant mycologist, went to hospital in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata after suffering from a hoarse voice, cough, fatigue and difficulties swallowing for three months. Scans revealed the man had a paratracheal abscess on his neck, and when pus samples were sent for testing, it emerged that he had been infected with Chondrostereum purpureum \u2013 the same fungus that causes silver leaf disease in plants. The infection comes after the hit show \u2018The Last of Us' \u2013 which is inspired by a real-life bacteria that turns ants into \u2018zombies\u2019 and can wipe out entire colonies \u2013 has raised the public profile of fungal diseases. In this case, the 61-year-old made a full recovery after receiving two antifungal medications for two months. However, the infection has alarmed public health experts as it was not previously thought that fungal spores in plants could infect human beings. It is believed the man had come into contact with the fungus while carrying out research in his job, which had brought him into contact with decaying plants and mushrooms over a long period of time. \u201cThere are literally hundreds of millions of fungal species and only a fraction that cause infections in humans but we are starting to see this strange phenomena of fungal infections that were not known to cause infections in humans, now causing infections,\u201d said Ramanan Laxminarayan, the Founder and President of the One Health Trust. \u201cObviously it is of concern about where the next pandemic is coming from and it could be caused by a fungal pathogen. But, thankfully, at the moment we don\u2019t have very effective transmission from person to person.\u201d Millions of fungal infections exist but scientists have only identified around 150,000. A handful can currently survive within the human body, such as Cryptococcus and Aspergillus, which can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Yet, according to the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections, 300 million people are affected by serious fungal pathogens each year, resulting in 1.6 million deaths. The pandemic has also exacerbated this threat. In 2021, at least 45,000 people in India who had developed Covid-19 contracted a secondary fungal infection, Mucormycosis, known as \u201cblack fungus\u201d , resulting in over 4,500 deaths. The coronavirus also diverted resources away from researching and treating lesser-known fungal pathogens. Between 2019 and 2021, the number of Candida auris infections, which can infect the bloodstream and central nervous system, tripled from 476 to 1,471 in the United States, for example. Fungal infections are expected to pose a greater threat to human beings in the years to come due to growing resistance to the small number of treatments available and rising temperatures, caused by climate change. Warmer temperatures could allow fungi to adapt more easily to survive within the human body and existing fungal infections could spread to new geographic areas. Last October, the World Health Organisation published the first watchlist highlighting the 19 most worrying pathogens , in the hope it would spur more investment into potential treatments and interventions to reduce the threat they pose. Among them was mycetoma \u2013 a \u201cdevastating\u201d chronic condition that slowly eats away at flesh and has been described as a \u201creal life Last of Us\u201d infection. Mostly detected in an arid region around Sudan, where it is spread by a thorn prick from an acacia tree, the disease remains poorly understood. There are no approved treatments, meaning amputation is often the only option to save lives. But on Thursday, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) announced an initiative to support the registration and rollout of a new drug, fosravuconazole, found to be safe, effective and easy to administer in recent large scale trials. \u201cFor decades, people affected by mycetoma have been largely ignored by medical research,\u201d said Dr Borna Nyaoke, Head of Mycetoma Programme at DNDi. \u201cUntil now, the limited treatments available for eumycetoma showed poor efficacy, even after 12 months of treatment.\u201d",2023-04-01T00:37:18,medical resources

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com I read with worry the account shared by Mrs Patricia Goh in her letter ( Long wait at polyclinic but still did not get to see doctor , March 14). It seems that despite the public-private-Government experience in the management of Covid-19 over the past three years, much is to be desired in patients\u2019 health-seeking behaviour. Patients with simple ailments do not need to head to a polyclinic or a hospital accident and emergency department. A general practitioner can manage simple ailments and more. Employers and their human resource departments should not make use of the public healthcare system for employee healthcare benefits because in doing so, public money will be used for corporate healthcare, which is not how taxpayer money should be spent. The work load from this group of patients will add to the strain that doctors and healthcare staff in hospitals and polyclinics face. This will result in patients who otherwise need care at these institutions being deprived of the level of care they need. The public also needs to place more trust in the processes of our healthcare institutions. These are usually implemented with good reasons. A clinical triage and initial assessment done by a health professional like a nurse helps in the allocation of limited healthcare resources in an institution. This follows the basic principle of allowing the more ill and infirm to seek help first. Patients who visit any health institution should not go with the expectation that they will be seen immediately, but that they will be advised to follow instructions at the institution. With more mutual cooperation, trust and understanding, our healthcare institutions will be able to carry out their duties properly. Jeremy Chan Zi Ping (Dr)",2023-03-17T11:37:57,medical expenses

The following are just my personal opinion. YMMV. 1) For existing users of any ISPs: no switching of ISP unless if you got issues or you got very good offers from the other ISPs. 2) Recommendation for new sign-up: M1 or Starhub 500Mbps or 1Gbps plan; avoid Singtel 1Gbps/2Gbps plan becuase of ONR. Singtel no longer entertains bridging request for 1Gbps plan since March 2022. Singtel 2Gbps plan will not allow ONR bridging at all. Number 1 plan to avoid is Singtel 2Gbps plan which is no better than Singtel 1Gbps plan for 99% of the use cases. It is also better to avoid Viewquest for new users due to stability issues unless you are a power user and you know what you are doing. Power users may like Viewquest due to the perceived higher performance. Viewquest is now using CGNAT as well but you can get static IP add-on (monthly subscription). MyRepublic is worth considering but take note of the CGNAT limitation (which can be easily mitigated by getting static IP at S$50 one time charge). Power users may consider MyRepublic due to perceived higher performance but there are recent negative feedbacks after Starhub takeover. Personal recommendation for average new subscribers and general use cases (no Starhub TV+ or Singtel TV services). Power users can ignore this recommendation. M1>= Starhub > MyRepublic (take note of the CGNAT thingy) > Singtel (not recommended because of ONR) > Whizzcomms (not recommended due to the fact that is get depriotized by Singtel when incidents happen) > Viewquest (not recommended becuase of stability concerns raised) 3) For existing Singtel ONR users (unbridged ONR 1Gbps), you may choose to stay if the limitation of the ONR does not bother you. If you feel the limitation then you may opt to move out. For existing Singtel ONT users for legacy plan and 1Gbps plan, you can keep the ONT upon recontract. However, please  take note you will be given ONR once you move to a new place. For existing bridged Singtel ONR users (bridged ONR for Singtel 1Gbps), you may need to contact Singtel before recontract to make sure they will keep the bridging status of your ONR before recontract. Most likely you can do that. 4) For Dual ISP users: M1+SH, M1+ MR, SH+MR and M1+MR are all good option to go.  M1+VQ or SH+VQ can be a good option as well since you can leverage the good performance of VQ for certain use cases. M1+WC or SH+WC can be considered as well as long as you ask WC to configure the ONR to ONT mode. 5)  DO NOT USE the FREE BUNDLED ROUTER as the base for choosing ISPs. In general, it is better to buy your own router as the free router is not really good. Or in some case, buy the higher end router from the ISP if it is a good deal (eg: M1 GT-AX6000 is a superb deal). But anyway, this is just my personal opionion and many are still using the free router as the base for choosing ISPs becuase they may rely on ISP to provide the technical support (even though the technical support is in general not good). ********************************* All the dual 1Gbps or 2Gbps plans from Singapore ISPs have the same limitation because of the use of GPON ONT. Download is up to 2Gbps combined, upload is up to 1Gbps. All the 1Gbps plans from Singapore ISPs have the same limitation because of the use of GPON ONT. Download is up to 1Gbps combined, upload is up to 1Gbps. Last time only MyRepublic has the lower upload limit at 500Mbps but that has been fixed recently. GPON: Theoreticaly max speed: 2.5 Gbit/s down, 1.25 Gbit/s up (ISPs can further limit the speed to 2Gbps download and 1Gbps upload) Starhub UltraSpeed (10Gbps trial) is using  XGS-PON ( theoretical max speed: 10Gbps download, 10Gbps upload). Singtel 10Gbps plan is using XG-PON ( theoretical max speed: 10Gbps download, 2.5Gbps upload) but will switch to XGS-PON in April 2023. ********************************* 1. SingTel : (1Gbps, 2Gbps, 1+1 Gbps Gamer plan, 10Gbps plan, also have legacy 500Mbps plan for existing users) Public IP: yes, no static add-on ONT users (existing 500Mbps and 1Gbps): 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), VLAN required ONT users (existing  legacy Unlimited 1Gbps Plan): 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), VLAN not required, no Singtel TV ONR users: 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), but you need to request from Singtel and it may not be easy SingTel provide same connection for Internet and Fibre TV, VLAN is needed. For ONR users, Vlan is handled by the ONR. SingTel 1+1Gbps plan, only use ONR. The ONR will be configured as three port unbridged ONR ports and one port bridged ONR port, the bridged port does not require VLAN. Certain users have asked Singtel to provide a special configuration for the ONR with the 1Gbps plan, three ports for SingTel TV only without internet access, one bridged ONR port which does not require VLAN. Note: Singtel has stopped to entertain ONR bridging request since March 2022. Avoid Singtel as an ISP in general unless you are fine with the super basic feature of the Singtel ONR (you can not even set up your own DNS server). Singtel 2Gbps plan: aggregated 2Gbps, must use Singtel ONR, not possible to bridge the ONR Note: avoid this plan as it offers practically benefits compared to 1Gbps plan for majority of the users. Singtel 10Gbps plan: use XG-PON ONR, 1 x 10G LAN port and 4 x 1G LAN ports. After April 2023, it will switch to better 10G-XGS-PON technology. Take not it is using ONR and you can not bridge the ONR. Strong point: very stable, may have some advantages in terms of routing to China and Europe. 2. Starhub (500Mbps, 1Gbps plan and 2Gbps plan, UltraSpeed trial with 10Gbps) Public IP, ONT, no vlan needed. With native dual stack IPv6. Starhub uses different ONT ports to deliver Fibre Internet (ONT Port 1) and Fibre TV if you are using the Fibre TV Set Top box (ONT Port 2). New Starhub TV+ box is different, it needs to be connected to the router. Starhub 2Gbps plan: ONT port 1 and ONT port 3 used to deliver 2x1Gbps connection, ONT port 2 for Starhub Fibre TV. Starhub UltraSpeed 10Gbps trial (fallback to 2Gbps plan if th trial failed). Please take not it is using XGS-PON ONR and you can not bridge the ONR. 3. M1 (500Mbps, 1Gbps plan and 2Gbps plan) Public IP, ONT, no vlan needed. Native dual stack IPv6. Customers can pay for Static IP add-on. M1 2Gbps plan: ONT port 1 and ONT port 2 used to deliver 2x1Gbps connection, 4. MyRepublic (200Mbps, 1Gbps and 1+1 Gbps plan). Using ONT Carrier Grade NAT, no public IP by default. You can pay one time charge of S$50 for the Static IP. No vlan needed. No IPv6. MR is perceived to have good speed and lower latency for some gamers but there are feedbacks of routing performance degradation after the takeover by Starhub. 5.Viewquest (500Mbps, 1Gbps, 2Gbps plan) 500Mbps/1Gbps plan: ONT or ONR (you can bridge) 2Gbps plan: ONR (2Gbps one network plan, aggregated 2Gbps plan similar to Singtel 2Gbps plan), you can not bridge the ONR. You need to pay for static IP add-on to get public IPv4 address. If not they started to use CGNAT like MyRepublic for new users. Existing users may have static IPv4 address for free. No IPv6. VQ is peceived to have good performance and lower latency for some gamers, but there are some staibity concerns based on the feedbacks from the VQ thread. 6. Whizcomms (300Mbps->500Mbps and 1Gbps plan) Public IP, no IPv6. Whizcomms provides ONR, but you can ask them to configure the ONR in ONT mode prior to installation without charges. No Vlan needed. 7. SIMBA (upcoming with 2.5Gbps plan at S$20 per month). SIMBA \u2013 formerly TPG Telecom SIMBA Mobile simba.sg Note: 1. Some people are worried about throttling of BT, here is the what I gathered, just for reference. Take note I myself support the throttling policy for BT. 1) Viewquest=MyRepublic (almost no throttling) > 2) M1 >=Starhub (a bit of throttling) > 3) SingTel (pretty heavy throttling) > Whizcomms (worst); throttling of BT and things like Google Drive Download 2.

Her treatment cost was fully covered by national insurance scheme MediShield Life and national medical savings scheme MediSave, until December 2022, when she had to top up $268.50 in cash. This came as a shock. She has yet to receive her January bill. But she is afraid she might have to continue to pay cash every month due to the change in the way cancer treatments for subsidised patients have been covered since Sept 1, 2022. The change essentially lowered her claim limits for both MediShield Life and MediSave. The September policy change was meant to slow down spiralling cancer costs as well as to help patients better afford cancer care, including more expensive drugs. Since then, both MediShield Life and MediSave were allowed to cover only approved cancer drug treatments. Treatments not on the Cancer Drug List cannot be covered. The same will apply to Integrated Shield Plan coverage from April 1, 2023. Before the change, subsidised patients could claim up to $3,000 a month for their total cancer treatment costs. They may also use an additional $1,200 a month from MediSave. Since September, cancer treatment claims have been split \u2013 with separate claim limits for drugs and services. Patients can now claim $200 to $9,600 a month for one cancer drug treatment. They may also claim up to $1,200 a year for cancer services, which include consultations, scans, lab investigations, chemotherapy preparation and administration, supportive care drugs and blood transfusions. Up to $600 a year from MediSave may also be used. The Ministry of Health (MOH) had said that with the change, 90 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients would have their cancer bills fully subsidised, subject to the 10 per cent co-payment, which MediSave can pay for. Before the change, 70 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients had their cancer bills fully subsidised. But oncologists from the public sector have told the MOH that the $1,200 MediShield Life cap on cancer services is inadequate. Several oncologists told The Straits Times that almost half of subsidised cancer patients, who used to be fully covered, will face similar problems as Ms W. A check with various public hospitals showed that fees for a repeat consultation for subsidised patients range from $21.60 to $72.50. Lab tests, even with subsidies, often cost more than $100, and for some, will top $200. Often, these need to be done every few weeks. Some patients need medication for side effects of treatment, such as nausea or an elevated blood pressure, but such drugs also now come under cancer services. Some need antibiotics when their immune systems are compromised by the medication, and these too come under cancer services. Other procedures such as blood transfusions for patients with blood cancers also add to their costs. Several oncologists, who asked not to be named, said this is clearly not enough. One public sector oncologist said the coverage \u201cneeds to be multiple times the current cap\u201d. Ms W has no problems with cancer drug cost. It is with the cancer services that she finds her insurance coverage inadequate. By her December bill, she had used up the $1,200 yearly coverage limit for cancer services. Her bills for these services range from $400 to more than $800 each month, depending on the tests and medications she requires. The MOH said on Saturday that the MediShield Life cap on cancer services claims will be raised to $3,600 a year from April. But the cap on MediSave withdrawal for cancer services remains at $600 a year. On hearing this, Ms W said: \u201cI\u2019m glad to know that they are revising the current MediShield and MediSave coverage to better help cancer patients. I do hope that the revised amount can at least cover all the necessary tests and scans that we patients have to undergo on a frequent basis.\u201d But the higher cap \u2013 which works out to $300 from MediShield Life and $50 from MediSave a month \u2013 will still not be enough to cover her bills for cancer services. Ms W added: \u201cWith cancer, my life is already uncertain. Every time I do the test, I worry that my cancer might flare up again. Now, I also face financial problems. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to deal with it.\u201d Because of her illness, she has stopped full-time work and is currently working part-time. But this is enough to put her out of reach of MediFund aid, which is a government safety net for the poor. \u201cAt least if insurance can\u2019t pay for this, I should be allowed to use my MediSave. I may not have many more years to live. Why limit MediSave withdrawal to $600 a year?\u201d she asked. Click to expand...

The tie-up between GIC and Mendaki is the latest initiative by the self-help group to grow its industry partnerships to position students to growth sectors. Those on the GIC-Mendaki scholarship will also gain access to internships, job rotations, networking opportunities and mentorship from GIC. The recipients will join the company with a bond of three years upon graduation. ""The support and partnerships from industry partners such as GIC reflect Mendaki's aspiration to build the competencies of our workforce by investing in our youth and their education,"" said Mr Zaqy, who is the self-help group's deputy chairman. ""I hope this initiative will encourage more partners to join our endeavour in supporting youth and young talents to pursue a career in growth industries and spur them to achieve excellence. Together, we are able to empower and navigate our talents, regardless of their background, towards success."" As part of efforts to support students in the community, Mr Zaqy also announced on Thursday that Mendaki's Institute of Technical Education (ITE) mentoring programme will be enhanced to take into account the unique needs of mentees, and to motivate them to do well in school. The ITE Empowerment Programme, which was piloted in 2019, saw more than 1,000 students take part in it last year. Mr Zaqy added that one in every five Malay-Muslim Nitec students were enrolled in the programme last year, with ninety-six per cent of participants remaining in school and progressing to their second year. Under a refreshed name, #amPowered@ITE, the programme will also be progressively made available under the Mendaki Tuition Scheme and at M3 towns. M3@Town is an initiative under the M3 programme - a tie-up between Mendaki, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore and the People's Association Malay Activity Executive Committees Council - to serve the community. Care advisers will also be deployed to the YouthSpaces in the three ITEs to complement the mentoring programme. YouthSpace is a collaboration between Mendaki and ITE to hold activities for students on campus. ""Their role is to guide students on possible education pathways, and connect them to skilling or emplacement opportunities,"" said Mr Zaqy. Budget debate: New scholarship for Malay students to pursue careers in finance The scholarship will cover tuition fees and living allowances, as well as programmes such as overseas exchanges and finance-related seminars.

Her treatment cost was fully covered by national insurance scheme MediShield Life and national medical savings scheme MediSave, until December 2022, when she had to top up $268.50 in cash. This came as a shock. She has yet to receive her January bill. But she is afraid she might have to continue to pay cash every month due to the change in the way cancer treatments for subsidised patients have been covered since Sept 1, 2022. The change essentially lowered her claim limits for both MediShield Life and MediSave. The September policy change was meant to slow down spiralling cancer costs as well as to help patients better afford cancer care, including more expensive drugs. Since then, both MediShield Life and MediSave were allowed to cover only approved cancer drug treatments. Treatments not on the Cancer Drug List cannot be covered. The same will apply to Integrated Shield Plan coverage from April 1, 2023. Before the change, subsidised patients could claim up to $3,000 a month for their total cancer treatment costs. They may also use an additional $1,200 a month from MediSave. Since September, cancer treatment claims have been split \u2013 with separate claim limits for drugs and services. Patients can now claim $200 to $9,600 a month for one cancer drug treatment. They may also claim up to $1,200 a year for cancer services, which include consultations, scans, lab investigations, chemotherapy preparation and administration, supportive care drugs and blood transfusions. Up to $600 a year from MediSave may also be used. The Ministry of Health (MOH) had said that with the change, 90 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients would have their cancer bills fully subsidised, subject to the 10 per cent co-payment, which MediSave can pay for. Before the change, 70 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients had their cancer bills fully subsidised. But oncologists from the public sector have told the MOH that the $1,200 MediShield Life cap on cancer services is inadequate. Several oncologists told The Straits Times that almost half of subsidised cancer patients, who used to be fully covered, will face similar problems as Ms W. A check with various public hospitals showed that fees for a repeat consultation for subsidised patients range from $21.60 to $72.50. Lab tests, even with subsidies, often cost more than $100, and for some, will top $200. Often, these need to be done every few weeks. Some patients need medication for side effects of treatment, such as nausea or an elevated blood pressure, but such drugs also now come under cancer services. Some need antibiotics when their immune systems are compromised by the medication, and these too come under cancer services. Other procedures such as blood transfusions for patients with blood cancers also add to their costs. Several oncologists, who asked not to be named, said this is clearly not enough. One public sector oncologist said the coverage \u201cneeds to be multiple times the current cap\u201d. Ms W has no problems with cancer drug cost. It is with the cancer services that she finds her insurance coverage inadequate. By her December bill, she had used up the $1,200 yearly coverage limit for cancer services. Her bills for these services range from $400 to more than $800 each month, depending on the tests and medications she requires. The MOH said on Saturday that the MediShield Life cap on cancer services claims will be raised to $3,600 a year from April. But the cap on MediSave withdrawal for cancer services remains at $600 a year. On hearing this, Ms W said: \u201cI\u2019m glad to know that they are revising the current MediShield and MediSave coverage to better help cancer patients. I do hope that the revised amount can at least cover all the necessary tests and scans that we patients have to undergo on a frequent basis.\u201d But the higher cap \u2013 which works out to $300 from MediShield Life and $50 from MediSave a month \u2013 will still not be enough to cover her bills for cancer services. Ms W added: \u201cWith cancer, my life is already uncertain. Every time I do the test, I worry that my cancer might flare up again. Now, I also face financial problems. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to deal with it.\u201d Because of her illness, she has stopped full-time work and is currently working part-time. But this is enough to put her out of reach of MediFund aid, which is a government safety net for the poor. \u201cAt least if insurance can\u2019t pay for this, I should be allowed to use my MediSave. I may not have many more years to live. Why limit MediSave withdrawal to $600 a year?\u201d she asked. Click to expand...

Half of expatriates surveyed here who renewed their housing leases recently were hit by rental hikes of more than 40 per cent, a survey by the European Chamber of Commerce found About seven in 10 businesses indicated they are ready to relocate their employees out of Singapore if no help is offered to manage rising operating costs The chamber's president told TODAY that Singapore's attractiveness to businesses has been harmed and is ""most dire"" it has been in at least the last 10 years SINGAPORE \u2014 Half of expatriates here have been hit by rental increases of more than 40 per cent, while about seven in 10 businesses are ready to relocate their staff out of Singapore if there is no relief from rising operating costs, a survey has found. Conducted by the European Chamber of Commerce, Singapore (EuroCham), the survey aimed to assess the extent and severity of the impact of rising costs of rental on business operations in Singapore. The report on the survey, released on Monday (March 27), warned that the situation is ""not sustainable"". If business costs do not fall or the Government does not step in to help, then ""Singapore will lose its attractiveness to foreign companies which will decide to relocate their offices to neighbouring countries"", the report said. \u201c This is the first time in the past 10 years where companies have expressed a readiness to leave Singapore should rental prices increase. European Chamber of Commerce's president Federico Donato \u201d The survey was done in collaboration with 14 European national business groups, the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce, the British Chamber of Commerce Singapore and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Singapore. READ ALSO Expats baulk at rising rents, as some think twice about staying in Singapore amid intensifying global talent war In all, 268 local and international businesses operating in Singapore, which are members of these chambers of commerce, responded to the survey. \u201cThis is the first time in the past 10 years where companies have expressed a readiness to leave Singapore should rental prices increase,\u201d said EuroCham president Federico Donato in reply to TODAY\u2019s queries. TODAY on Sunday reported how some expatriates here are intending to leave Singapore amid the skyrocketing rental prices \u2014 which rose at the fastest pace in 15 years last year, outpacing some other major cities. IMPACT ON EXPATRIATES The survey found that 50 per cent of employees who have had to renew their residential housing lease this year or last year had faced rental increases of more than 40 per cent. Another 36 per cent found that the hike was between 20 and 40 per cent. \u201cIt is a significant increase that has a direct consequence on European expatriates and businesses in the city-state,\u201d said the report. READ ALSO The Big Read in short: Impact of high rents on doing business As many as 62 per cent either received less than S$1,500 a month or nothing at all from their companies to offset the rent increase. ADVERTISEMENT Beyond economic impact, 97 per cent of the companies surveyed indicated that employees exhibited visible anxiety and psychological distress over rising costs of housing rent in Singapore 7 IN 10 BUSINESSES READY TO RELOCATE STAFF Asked to indicate the most important factors that have led to an increase in operational costs, 22 per cent of respondents cited ""increased cost of rental: Residential allowance for employees"". General cost increase due to inflation came in a close second at 21 per cent, followed by rising salaries (18 per cent). On how badly the business has been affected by rising costs of residential rental, more than half, or 53 per cent, gave a rating of four or five on a five-point scale \u2014 with five being the most badly affected. Given the rising costs of operations, 69 per cent of companies indicated they would be ready to relocate their personnel out of Singapore. ADVERTISEMENT READ ALSO S'pore private rental prices jump 30% in 2022, fastest pace in 15 years; experts expect slower rise in 2023 ""European and foreign companies are genuinely considering relocating part of their business outside Singapore,"" said EuroCham in a press release on the survey. In his comments to TODAY, Mr Donato said: \u201cAs the rental has increased by a large extent, Singapore's attractiveness to businesses has likewise been harmed. ""This is the most dire it has been in the last 10 years, from our knowledge."" He added that the survey indicated that it was not just the rental costs but also growing travel and shipping costs, for example, which impose added challenges for the businesses. \u201cEuroCham and the other chambers and member companies hope that the Government can intervene in the housing market to drive down the prices of rent, or implement a price ceiling,\u201d he said. In response to TODAY\u2019s queries on what is being done to help such firms cope with rising costs and whether the Government is looking into extending them more, the Ministry of Trade and Industry referred to a written reply to a parliamentary question last September. In the reply, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said that businesses need to ""continue to improve productivity to overcome the issue of rising costs"". He listed schemes to boost productivity such as the Productivity Solutions Grant to support transformation efforts and the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit to support workers\u2019 upskilling efforts. TODAY separately sent queries to the Economic Development Board (EDB) on when was the last time Singapore experienced a significant relocation of companies to other countries, among other questions. In response, an EDB spokesman said that rents in Singapore are comparable to major cities. The recent rise in rents in Singapore is a phenomenon also seen in other cities around the world due to pandemic-related construction delays and post-pandemic economy recovery, the spokesman added. The rental spike here is further linked to strong demand from companies and global talent to relocate to Singapore, as the nation continues to draw investments from businesses seeking to tap into the growth of Asia. ""Our attractiveness lies in our good digital and logistics connectivity, skilled workforce as well as our vibrant innovation and start-up ecosystem,"" the spokesman said. ""We are also a liveable city and safe haven for top talent, given our world class healthcare system, education system, connectivity and rule of law."" The spokesman added that according to the Ministry of National Development, residential prices in Singapore are expected to stabilise further as cooling measures work their way through the market and more supply comes on stream. Furthermore, there are also early signs that both the resale and rental markets are slowing down. Last week, EDB managing director Jacqueline Poh also took to LinkedIn to comment on the sharp hikes in residential rental prices, especially in prime areas. She noted two \u201cimportant facts\u201d that are overlooked when discussing the issue. \u201cRentals did not rise significantly for a decade before Covid. (And) as a result, even now rents are comparable to many major cities, especially if you look beyond specific \u2018hot\u2019 districts,\u201d Ms Poh wrote. She concluded the post by saying that 100,000 private and public homes are set to be completed by 2025, with 40 per cent of them to be completed by this year. \u201cThis increase in supply should help relieve the pressure and moderate the cost of living.\u201d REGIONAL CITIES ARE CATCHING UP: ECONOMIST Economist Walter Theseira said that the Government has previously intervened to develop appropriate industrial spaces and support housing for foreign talent, such as via the development of Jurong Industrial Estate and the implementation of the Scheme for Housing of Foreign Talent. However, a direct intervention in the market would risk \u201cthe possibility of harming the economy by stopping the natural flow of more value-added businesses which will displace lower value-added ones\u201d, said the associate professor from the Singapore University of Social Sciences. One reason that Singapore is expensive is the large number of businesses and people that want to be here, he said. \u201c Singapore has to be the superior choice for high value added business even with high costs. Economist Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences \u201d Regional cities are catching up in various ways such as in terms of quality of manpower, infrastructure and quality of life, Assoc Prof Theseira said. To remain competitive, Singapore must maintain \u201ca particular niche or competitiveness so that people still want to be here\u201d regardless of these costs, he said, giving the example of how the San Francisco bay area, despite being \u201cnotoriously expensive\u201d, remains attractive to startups. \u201cSingapore has to be the superior choice for high-value-added business even with high costs,\u201d he said. Assoc Prof Theseira acknowledged that price rises have been too steep for comfort, posing a problem for domestic and foreign businesses alike, but he said that this is transitory because of the quick post-pandemic recovery.",2023-03-29T21:12:28,skillsfuture

Like SGS, the Singapore Savings Bonds are safe investments, principal-guaranteed by the government, Mrs Teo said. Holders of the SSB can also get their money back in any given month, with no penalty, and can earn interest that is linked to long-term SGS rates. Also, unlike bonds that pay the same coupons each year, the SSB pays coupons that increase over time. The government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are still working on the details of the SSB programme, and will release more information later. To improve the availability of corporate bonds to Singapore retail investors, MAS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) will also ease the financial and administrative costs for issuers seeking to tap the retail market, Mrs Teo said. Two new frameworks as well as a tax deduction have been proposed, and MAS and SGX are targeting to implement the proposals in the second quarter of 2015. ""We hope that corporate issuers with strong financials will utilise the new frameworks and tax concession to issue retail bonds, which will enhance the investment choices for Singaporean investors,"" Mrs Teo said.",2015-03-26T14:31:58,income inequality

They were speaking to The Straits Times on 2022 household income figures released by the Singapore Department of Statistics (SingStat) on Thursday. Median monthly household income from work rose 0.2 per cent in real terms, or after adjusting for inflation, in 2022. This is lower than the 1.5 per cent increase registered in 2021. After adjusting for inflation, households in the first nine deciles saw real income growth. Only the top decile saw a drop in real income. Asked why this is so, analysts said the highest income group could be most affected by high inflation, as they spend more on big-ticket items such as cars, air tickets and private properties. Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the National University of Singapore Business School\u2019s Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said top income earners are usually professionals whose incomes are subject to variations due to the economic situation, which has not been favourable in recent years. \u201cIt is normally more difficult to sustain the high bases in income as one goes up the earnings ladder,\u201d he added. Experts said cost of living remains a concern, especially for middle-income households. The fall in income inequality, they added, showed that Government measures to uplift the lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Model and Workfare Income Supplement scheme have been effective. Income inequality is also moderated by government transfers. Government job and wage support schemes during the pandemic allowed lower income earners to maintain their pay or even keep their jobs, said Prof Loh. After adjusting for government transfers and taxes, the Gini coefficient in 2022 fell from 0.437 to 0.378. This compares favourably with some developing nations, which have a Gini coefficient of around 0.6, said NUS sociology professor Tan Ern Ser. But a look at wealth inequality may present a different picture, he added. Wealthier individuals may have income from sources other than employment, such as investments, property and inherited wealth, which are not accounted for in SingStat data. CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the increase in real household incomes showed that the post-Covid-19 re-opening of the economy has created more opportunities, with the labour market tightening significantly. To further narrow the income gap in the long run, higher wages and quality jobs would help the lowest earners. He said that while inflation remains high, it may have peaked in 2022. \u201cInflation becomes a concern only when it becomes entrenched, and expectations for inflation continue to rise and outstrip nominal wage growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do see this... where we have supply disruptions and various issues like the Ukraine war, but it looks like the worst of inflation may be behind us.\u201d OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said: \u201cInflation may not ease significantly this year, at least not in the first half of the year, especially for core inflation, so both nominal and real wage income growth may remain muted. \u201cFor households, especially middle income ones, they will likely still feel the pain from being squeezed by higher prices for most goods and services, as well as higher debt servicing burdens due to rising interest rates.\u201d She added that nominal wage growth may not keep pace with inflation in 2023, with headline and core inflation likely to come in at around 6 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. But, she observed, unemployment rates are very low and employment gains jumped in 2022. Higher-income earners hit by expensive items; worst of inflation may be over: Analysts Experts said cost of living remains a concern, especially for middle-income households.

Do you think this is insubordination?,"Spoiler: FULL STORY.. Basically me gave some constructive feedback and hoping they get their actions together. somehow backfire and upset the director favourite pet and indirectly pointing out parties that\u2019s been sleeping on the job.. my director probably guilty, and he being small gas and petty who always think his word is final, acting almighty like amdk or sovereign, he can never take a single bit of criticism since all he hear is flattery all these years and the ego is bigger until don\u2019t know what.. Spoiler: TLDR.. full story here.. Somehow this is a word that I never would have imagine that one day will have link/tagged to me. INSUBORDINATION . U all should know that bbfa are probably the most peace loving creature on earth, we normally don\u2019t fight since we can\u2019t win anyone in terms of being the favourites.. I also don\u2019t speak up either, everything we just swallow (don\u2019t think dirty) and by being on the rat race for such a long time, we all know that everyone is equal, but the truth is some are more equal than others So poor me had been doing two person role since the company M&A during covid period.. there\u2019s no increase in perks or anything, at least I got to keep my job despite not being the brightest star but I had been doing my work well and I\u2019m cheap to hire and keep la.. my manager also assured me certain agreements had been agreed and put in place that will make my work better and more smooth so two person workload is actually manageable or even less than before.. But in reality this isn\u2019t really the case and I had been suffering quite a lot over it all these one plus year but just sucked it up.. Recently the demands and standards got worse and my manager isn\u2019t even helping or on my side even.. all saving their own skin only.. So me decided to pluck out my one last courage and voice it out.. I emailed to the dept (cc Manager & Director) that\u2019s making my life terrible and in the email.. I am still being very polite no vulgarities, name shaming or finger pointing either. So I think I did a good job in describing the problem faced, how it could be better, suggesting solutions and highlighting the agreement in place. Though I agreed that with years of being on edmw, I had small mastery of how to scold a person without making myself ugly and remaining graceful.. all with the hope of they will at least show some face since I had brought up the matter and manager and director But somehow I think the ppl in the department I shooting at is the director favourite pet and somehow it shows the director sleeping on the job and incapable to manage its staff to allow this to happen.. Behind the scene I heard from my manager that the director proposed a urgent meeting with him to discuss over my email and the conclusion the director have is that my actions equates to insubordination and I could get myself fired. And today I received a email from HR first thing in the morning that they are holding a formal inquiry on the matter. and it seems like they are going down as insubordination. What do u think I should do? And am I really wrong? Will MOM be on my side? Does this justify for termination? Any advice greatly appreciated.. Thanks in advance.. Update 03/04/23: Not bumping this thread but rather updating the outcome on the first post.. As i want to see who really cares about me and bother to follow this thread.. Poll results 21-YES and 25-NO.. So i had the talk with HR, but they didn't really bring up the insubordination into the picture, so i also acted blur and remain quiet on my part of course. Maybe not to the extent of getting me fired so they rather dont touch on it but just give a verbal warning.. After all i had good performance all along and the feedback i had sent in the email is also for the general good, all facts anyway and im not the troublemaker to begin with.. though yes emotional and i should had went through the ""proper hierarchy even if it goes on deaf ears"" or i can always go to HR.. Was made to apologize to the director, other than that no official records left on my personnel booklet..

On March 30, AsiaOne spoke to veteran radio hosts and comedians Mark Lee and Marcus Chin at the Star Awards 2023 Gala Dinner, where they won the Best Radio Programme third time in a row. The two, as well as Dennis Chew and Chen Biyu host Love 972's morning show The Breakfast Quartet. Recently, 69-year-old Marcus shared on TikTok that his daughter Elise suffers from epilepsy . The 12-year-old, who lives in Johor Bahru with her mother and two younger sisters, was hospitalised for 10 days earlier this year and again for six days this month. Elise has to take two kinds of medicine a day and go to the hospital for follow-up visits every three weeks. Her appetite is affected and though previously described as ""gentle"", she has become more irritable. When AsiaOne asked Mark, 54, if he has shared any advice with Marcus, he replied: ""He is my friend and co-worker, of course I support him unconditionally in all areas, be it emotional, scheduling or even financial. ""As a father, I know his pain too. He probably felt the same way I did ."" Mark had felt pain at his younger daughter's condition too . Calynn, nine, was diagnosed with glomerulonephritis (a kidney condition) after an immune reaction to a virus she contracted in 2018. Marcus, who looked like he was holding back tears, then deadpanned seemingly to lighten the mood: ""Elise was hospitalised for over 10 days, so the medical expenses are huge. I need to ask for an advance of 200,000 ringgit (S$60,160) from King Kong."" King Kong Media Production manages Marcus and is owned by Mark. True to their chemistry, Mark replied without missing a beat: ""No problem, Malaysian ringgit right?"" Mark then replied solemnly: ""I have no problem lending money to friends when it's for a good reason. It's a must to help when it concerns a life, a young life."" Mark also expressed faith that good energy can improve Elise's medical condition, and encouraged Marcus that Elise will recover quickly as long as he stays optimistic.

The latest figure, announced Friday, is lower than Singapore's previous low of 1.1 set in 2020 and lower than Japan's 2021 level. The resident total fertility rate refers to the average number of live births a woman has during her reproductive years. Indranee Rajah, who serves as minister in the Prime Minister's Office, told a parliamentary committee that the falling fertility rate was because of people marrying later and parents caring for older family members at the same time as children as the population grays. The decline also was partly due to the Year of the Tiger ""in the lunar calendar, which is generally associated with lower births among the Chinese,"" the minister said. But critics point to a high cost of living in the city state as a deeper cause. About 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing under the Housing & Development Board (HDB). Prices of these homes continue to rise, which contributes to couples waiting longer to marry and start a family. In this month's budget proposal, the government called for bigger cash payouts at birth, a doubling of parental leave for fathers and increased support for HDB home purchases. A total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered ""replacement level,"" which represents the average number of children a woman would need to have to reproduce herself by bearing a daughter who survives to childbearing age, according to the United Nations. Singapore is not the only Asian economy facing demographic headwinds. South Korea's total fertility rate fell to a new low of 0.78 last year, the lowest out of the 38 members of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Japan, which had a fertility rate of 1.3 in 2021, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government has vowed to increase the budget for child rearing support .",2023-02-26T11:05:13,lower class

On March 30, AsiaOne spoke to veteran radio hosts and comedians Mark Lee and Marcus Chin at the Star Awards 2023 Gala Dinner, where they won the Best Radio Programme third time in a row. The two, as well as Dennis Chew and Chen Biyu host Love 972's morning show The Breakfast Quartet. Recently, 69-year-old Marcus shared on TikTok that his daughter Elise suffers from epilepsy . The 12-year-old, who lives in Johor Bahru with her mother and two younger sisters, was hospitalised for 10 days earlier this year and again for six days this month. Elise has to take two kinds of medicine a day and go to the hospital for follow-up visits every three weeks. Her appetite is affected and though previously described as ""gentle"", she has become more irritable. When AsiaOne asked Mark, 54, if he has shared any advice with Marcus, he replied: ""He is my friend and co-worker, of course I support him unconditionally in all areas, be it emotional, scheduling or even financial. ""As a father, I know his pain too. He probably felt the same way I did ."" Mark had felt pain at his younger daughter's condition too . Calynn, nine, was diagnosed with glomerulonephritis (a kidney condition) after an immune reaction to a virus she contracted in 2018. Marcus, who looked like he was holding back tears, then deadpanned seemingly to lighten the mood: ""Elise was hospitalised for over 10 days, so the medical expenses are huge. I need to ask for an advance of 200,000 ringgit (S$60,160) from King Kong."" King Kong Media Production manages Marcus and is owned by Mark. True to their chemistry, Mark replied without missing a beat: ""No problem, Malaysian ringgit right?"" Mark then replied solemnly: ""I have no problem lending money to friends when it's for a good reason. It's a must to help when it concerns a life, a young life."" Mark also expressed faith that good energy can improve Elise's medical condition, and encouraged Marcus that Elise will recover quickly as long as he stays optimistic.

Like SGS, the Singapore Savings Bonds are safe investments, principal-guaranteed by the government, Mrs Teo said. Holders of the SSB can also get their money back in any given month, with no penalty, and can earn interest that is linked to long-term SGS rates. Also, unlike bonds that pay the same coupons each year, the SSB pays coupons that increase over time. The government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are still working on the details of the SSB programme, and will release more information later. To improve the availability of corporate bonds to Singapore retail investors, MAS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) will also ease the financial and administrative costs for issuers seeking to tap the retail market, Mrs Teo said. Two new frameworks as well as a tax deduction have been proposed, and MAS and SGX are targeting to implement the proposals in the second quarter of 2015. ""We hope that corporate issuers with strong financials will utilise the new frameworks and tax concession to issue retail bonds, which will enhance the investment choices for Singaporean investors,"" Mrs Teo said.",2015-03-26T14:31:58,household annual income

I'm bored because it's a Sunday. I walked past an ex-crush which I confessed to and got rejected and I'm just thinking about past rejections. First story(2021): I asked out a poly classmate of a different race. I thought she was cute. nice and mentally mature. She had a falling out with a mutual friend and I wanted her to feel less alone in class. Got a date. It was fun for both of us but after that she said we should be friends and I just said ok. She then changed classes. I never asked why she didn't want to be with me but for three weeks after the date I tried to keep up the friendship but I could tell she didn't really want it then she stopped talking to me and soon changed classes after that. I talked to a counselor about it and she said that I wasn't at fault because I gave her a chance (three weeks) to talk to me about it but she didn't. Second story(2013 and 2018): I asked this girl out twice. I was sec 1 and I had a classmate that had short hair. People called her ugly and crude but that was just my type so I asked her out she said no. In the coming years she would sometimes say ""why nobody wants me"" that hurt a lot because I was nobody apparently. She would also talk to my best mates while ignoring me. One time I was paired up with her for kayaking and she exclaimed: ""is this for real"" and didn't paddle but I was strong for my age so it was fine. I developed anxiety and harmed myself multiple times during sec school. Fast forward to 2018 now sec 5. At this point she had grew her hair out and was way better looking. She started flirting with me somewhat and when I had an anxiety attack she came to talk to me. I took it as she didn't hate me so a while later I asked her out again but she said we should be friends. Third story(2014): This is the girl I saw yesterday. She was the class rep/monitor and I found her really pretty and nice not much story with this one. It only hurt because after she rejected me she went and dated my parkour buddy. I then stopped talking as much with my parkour buddy and quit parkour a year later although not purely because of that. About me: I would probably rate myself 5-6 maybe 7 when I have a good day out of 10 in looks and I used to be somewhat chubby never fat but I'm working out a lot now and have lost a lot of fat after the recent rejection. I don't talk much which might be my weak point although I can talk a lot one-on-one on a date. I think I am a nice person but I can be an asshole when I want. I'm pretty short 165cm Some thoughts: I feel pretty bummed out because it feels like for the last 9 years I've been trying I have failed and it feels like I have been singled out or something. Granted I had anger issues from 2014-2017 and was really disagreeable towards teachers and rules because my family situation was really bad. I was also rejected in ways that make me feel like utter trash that well, to say it kinda ****ed me up is an understatement. However, I have now grown and improved a lot in the last 6 months mentally and physically.",2021-11-14T16:16:34,middle class

When you can start applying: Typically in the evening on the day it is announced. So check in the evening. How to apply: If you refer to the link only can only apply through the 3 local banks. would suggesting using browser webpage to apply cause their apps may not supported. DBS: Invest > Singapore Government Securities (SGS) > T-Bill > Deadline to apply: Based on what's known at the time of writing, application typically closes 1 day before auction @ 9pm for OCBC and DBS and based on what's reported by some, 12 noon for UOB (in dispute). But do yourself a favour by checking instead of relying on whats written on a public forum where you cannot hold anybody accountable for. it is for you to lose. Outcome and refund: you will know the outcome of the auction on the day of the auction after it happens (auction takes place around 1 pm, so you should know not too long after that so just be patient to wait). if you are successful, the ""interest"" (or discount) will be refunded to you the same day by around 5pm. if you are unsuccessful, the amount should also be refunded to you by 5pm same day. It has been reported that if you are successful OCBC will send you a text and email to inform you DBS will only send you a letter after the t-bill has been issued (see the issuance calendar for that) UOB will send you a text but in any case this is not really important as a refund of the interest already mean you are successful. Credit: you can see the t-bill in CDP around 5pm (might take longer if overwhelming subscription) on the issue date. it isn't like SSB where there is an additional seperate portal you can log in to see. in any case seeing it in CDP is the most important since that's where it is held in CDP you should be seeing 10 units if you applied for 1,000, as the face value is 100 per t-bill End of Tenor: the face value will be credited to your bank account linked to CDP Multiple applications: users have reported that you can submit multiple applications, e.g., non comp, comp @ 2.5%, comp @ 3%. CPF Application: Has to be done in branch of the 3 local banks. @Happyhappydays has kindly shared that for T-Bill application with CPFIS, only the amount AFTER discount is deducted. So e.g., apply 10k in the most recently concluded auction, where cut-off price is 98.577. only $9,857.70 gets deducted. Unlike cash, where 10k gets deducted, followed by a credit of 142.30.

Beyond www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: Following two years of major spending to contain COVID-19's economic impact and with the need to invest in longer-term social infrastructure, this year's Budget will likely see the spotlight being shone on the issue of fiscal sustainability, economists and tax experts said. Beyond Budget 2022, the national conversation about possible changes to Singapore's tax system is set to continue, they added. Taxes will be in focus when Finance Minister Lawrence Wong delivers his Budget speech on Friday (Feb 18), these observers said. One of which, to no surprise, will be the long-planned Goods and Services Tax (GST) increase that the authorities have described as critical for bringing in the additional revenue that Singapore needs for an ageing population. \u201cThe past two years of pandemic has taken a huge toll on Singapore\u2019s fiscal resources, and there is now an urgent need to refocus on fiscal sustainability,\u201d DBS senior economist Irvin Seah said. KPMG Singapore\u2019s tax partner See Wei Hua noted that Budget 2022 will be \u201cone of the more tax-focused budgets in recent years\u201d. \u201c(People are watching) for any changes to the tax regime, especially given that the Government has tapped more than S$50 billion of the reserves over the last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that we are emerging from COVID-19, the question is how can the Government make sure that its fiscal condition will be sustainable over the longer period?\u201d RISING EXPENDITURE\u200b Singapore is not alone. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Indonesia, have also started mulling tax hikes. As the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) pointed out in a report last year, the pandemic \u201chas caused a significant deterioration in public finances, which calls for a rethink of tax and spending policies once the recovery is well underway"". The fight against the pandemic over the last two years has seen Singapore accumulating budget deficits of S$75 billion, while drawing the equivalent of about 20 years of fiscal surpluses from past reserves . Prior to COVID-19, public expenditure was already on the rise with the Government\u2019s revenue struggling to keep up. Over a 10-year period from FY2010 to FY2019, yearly expenditure on government administration, economic development and social development rose by an average of 9.1 per cent, 7.7 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively, according to a report from UOB. On the other hand, operating revenue \u2013 derived largely from taxes \u2013 grew at a slower rate of 6.6 per cent per year over the same period. According to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), tax collections accounted for 73.6 per cent of the Government\u2019s total revenue in FY2020. As a result, the Government\u2019s primary balance, defined as operating revenue minus total expenditure, has been negative in five out of the past six fiscal years, noted UOB economist Barnabas Gan. \u201cThis suggests that tax receipts including that of personal income, corporate and GST have not been enough to cover the rising expenditure costs,\u201d he said. The \u201conly way\u201d to close this deficit in the primary balance has been to tap on the net investment returns contribution, noted Barclays economist Brian Tan. \u201cThis is not sustainable. You\u2019ll ideally want that to be a bonus that you can do without, instead of something you\u2019re absolutely dependent on for fiscal sustainability.\u201d Moving forward, the Government\u2019s spending will only go up in the face of challenges such as a rapidly ageing population and climate change. For instance, Singapore\u2019s healthcare spending has tripled in dollar terms over the past decade, now standing at 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). This expenditure is expected to hit 3 per cent of GDP by 2030, and will \u201c keep rising \u201d even beyond that, authorities have said. Such longer-term needs will incur \u201csignificant costs\u201d and require a sustainable source of revenue, said Mr Seah. \u201cUnfortunately, there aren\u2019t many options available when it comes to reliable sources of tax revenue,\u201d he added, noting that there is \u201climited\u201d room to tweak corporate and personal income tax rates without diluting the country\u2019s overall competitiveness. Corporate and personal income taxes have been the country\u2019s top two biggest sources of tax revenues, typically making up more than half of total annual tax collections. GST, which accounts for slightly more than one-fifth of tax revenue on average, comes in third. This explains the choice of a GST hike to keep Singapore\u2019s fiscal position on a more sustainable footing, experts said. Meanwhile, discussions about wealth taxation and a higher carbon tax have grown over the years. As Singapore navigates the post-pandemic world, experts said it will need to find the sweet spot in meeting economic and social goals, while balancing public finances. \u201cSingapore\u2019s focus will need to involve building a progressive economic and tax structure that allows the country to take bold steps to grow, while mitigating transition pains and ensuring that no one is left behind,\u201d said KPMG Singapore\u2019s partner and head of tax Ajay Kumar Sanganeria. GST HIKE: NOT IF, BUT WHEN\u200b The GST was first introduced in Singapore in 1994 at the rate of 3 per cent. It was then raised to 4 per cent in 2003, 5 per cent in 2004, before being increased to the current rate of 7 per cent in 2007. The GST, being a broad-based tax applied on a wide range of goods and services and on anyone who consumes regardless of age or income, is less affected by business cycles and ageing demographics. This means it is more stable and predictable, experts said. It is also seen as an efficient tax with a low cost of administration. Singapore first announced its plan to raise the GST by two percentage points, from 7 to 9 per cent, in 2018. The increase was deferred last year in view of COVID-19, but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong indicated in his New Year message that the Government will \u201c have to start moving \u201d on the planned hike now that the economy is on the mend. The spectre of rising inflation is unlikely to derail the GST hike, said experts, adding that there is never a good time to raise taxes. Mr Tan, who believes that the increase could happen as early as April, said: \u201cWe are bound to have an increase in inflation, regardless of when they pull the trigger. The timing is not going to change things materially.\u201d Mr Seah reckons the tax change may kick in by July, going by how the GST hike in 2007 took effect about five months after it was announced in that year\u2019s Budget. Others say businesses will need time \u2013 from three to six months or even longer \u2013 to adjust their budgeting and price displays, hence the \u201cwindow period\u201d for change may even stretch until early next year. With the same consideration in mind, experts are also expecting the two-percentage-point increase to be done at one go, as staggering the hike will result in inconveniences for businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s like removing a plaster,\u201d said PwC\u2019s tax leader Chris Woo. \u201cBetter to just do it quickly and get it up to 9 per cent.\u201d DBS estimates that the two-percentage-point hike in GST will yield an additional S$3.2 billion to S$3.6 billion in tax revenues a year. That said, the Government is aware of concerns that the tax increase will add to the cost of living. It has set aside a S$6 billion Assurance Package which it said will cushion the impact by at least 5 years for most households. Earlier this week, Mr Wong, the finance minister, reiterated that there will be \u201c a comprehensive set of measures \u201d to support lower- and middle-income households, as well as retirees. Mr Tan expects the Assurance Package, which was first announced in Budget 2020, to be bolstered with \u201ca little more support\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will stick to what they have set aside. I think they will supplement it, and the question is what form that will take,\u201d said the Barclays economist. \u201cIf you go by 2007\u2019s offset package which included cash handouts and subsidies that are geared more towards the lower-income groups, I think you will see a similar pattern this time.\u201d",2022-02-12T11:25:21,wealth tax

The CPF Board on Wednesday (Mar 8) noted that most of these accounts have low balances, with more than two-thirds of the accounts holding less than S$5,000 each. Owners of these accounts have received contributions from employers, or made voluntary contributions before 2003. They also include former Singapore citizens and permanent residents who have since relinquished their citizenship or permanent residency status. Account owners will have up until Mar 31, 2024, to transfer their CPF savings to their personal bank accounts. Remaining savings can still be transferred at any time after the accounts\u2019 automatic closures on Apr 1, 2024, but will cease to earn the prevailing CPF interest rate. Non-Singapore citizen/permanent resident employees who wish to continue saving in Singapore may consider options such as the Supplementary Retirement Scheme, or other relevant commercial investment products, said the CPF Board. The automatic closure of CPF accounts for all non-Singapore citizens and permanent residents in 2024 comes as the \u201cfinal step in ensuring that the CPF system focuses on its core objective of catering to the retirement, housing and healthcare needs of (existing) Singapore citizens and permanent residents\u201d, said the CPF Board. \u201cThe purpose of the CPF system is to help Singapore citizens and permanent residents retire with a peace of mind. In line with this, CPF members who are not Singapore citizens and permanent residents will have to close their CPF accounts.\u201d Prior to 1987, CPF contributions were mandatory for all employees working in Singapore \u2013 including those who did not have Singapore citizen and permanent resident status. The requirement was dropped in 1987, but non-Singapore citizen/permanent resident employees working in Singapore on work permits could opt to contribute to their CPF accounts on a voluntary basis. This was extended to non-Singapore citizen/permanent resident employees working in Singapore on all types of work passes, and not just work permit holders, from 1995. Non-Singapore citizen/permanent resident employees were disallowed from making voluntary contributions to their CPF accounts from 2003. Previously, the CPF Board told The Business Times that Singapore citizens and permanent residents renouncing their citizenship or residency statuses were \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to close their CPF accounts, as these members had no intention of retiring in Singapore.",2023-03-08T12:29:00,CPF

He was responding to questions by several Members of Parliament from the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP), Workers\u2019 Party (WP) and Progress Singapore Party (PSP) about the Government's justification for increasing premiums, the schemes available to help those who cannot afford it, as well as the rise in hospital charges. The MediShield Life Council had announced in September several recommendations to enhance MediShield Life benefits and adjust premiums upwards by up to 35 per cent for some. It is the first major review of the national insurance scheme since it was introduced in 2015. Giving a breakdown of the figures, Dr Koh said that over the last four years, the number of MediShield claimants increased by about 30 per cent and annual payouts went up by about 40 per cent. Between 2001 and 2019, average hospitalisation bills for public healthcare institutions increased by about 6 per cent a year on average, affected by medical cost inflation, demographics and medical advancements over the years, he added. ""This growth in utilisation and payout accounts for about two-thirds of the premium increases,"" he told the House. One-quarter of the premium increase comes from \u201crefreshing\u201d the claim limits of MediShield Life, while the remaining portion, just under 10 per cent, \u201csupports the benefit enhancements\u201d, including those implemented since 2018. These include the extension of coverage to include inpatient hospices and serious pregnancy complications. \u201cPremiums have been kept unchanged for the first five years of MediShield Life, in line with our earlier public commitment. They need to be adjusted to ensure that the MediShield Life Fund remains solvent and sustainable so that it can meet its obligations to all policyholders,\u201d said Dr Koh. Responding to a question from PSP Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai on whether it is unusual by international standards for a health insurance scheme to increase its premiums by 35 per cent in a single adjustment, Dr Koh said it would not be appropriate to compare with other schemes as premiums are priced based on multiple factors \u201cwhich inevitably vary from country to country\u201d. ""It would also not be meaningful to compute how much premiums a Singaporean will need to pay over his lifetime simply by assuming a fixed compounding factor each year,"" said Dr Koh. \u201cFuture premiums would depend on how the underlying drivers \u2026 evolve, and this depends on many factors including what we can achieve together to manage healthcare costs. The amount of premium subsidies an individual will receive will also vary over his lifetime, depending on his financial circumstances.\u201d KEEPING PREMIUMS AFFORDABLE Financial support schemes are available to ensure that all Singaporeans can continue to pay their premiums, said Dr Koh. For instance, lower- and middle-income households, as well as seniors from the Merdeka Generation and Pioneer Generation will receive premium subsidies and support. \u201cTaken together, about 35 per cent of the total premiums collected were paid for by the Government through various subsidies and support schemes in 2019. For the elderly aged 65 and above, the contribution from the Government is even higher, at about 50 per cent of their premiums,\u201d he said. Singaporeans can use MediSave to pay for their premiums in full, and they can also use their MediSave to pay for their family members\u2019 premiums as well. Those who still require more help can apply for Additional Premium Support, including those who are mid-way through medical treatment or who have recently lost their jobs and part of their income. The Additional Premium Support will cover all outstanding and future premiums, said Dr Koh. In addition, Singaporeans will receive a COVID-19 subsidy for the next two years, which will \u201cpay for the bulk of the premium increase in the first year\u201d, said Dr Koh. He noted that the Government had considered deferring the MediShield Life review and the premium increases due to the current \u201cdifficult economic situation\u201d with COVID-19. \u201cHowever, I must emphasise that it was important that MediShield Life remains solvent and sustainable so that it can meet its obligations in time to come when policyholders make claims. Its coverage also has to be updated and enhanced to remain relevant to the healthcare needs of Singaporeans,\u201d he said. PART OF PREMIUMS SET ASIDE FOR FUTURE Touching on the MediShield Life Fund, Dr Koh said a portion of premiums paid by working adults is set aside to provide for future premium rebates, which will help to moderate premium increases as people age. ""This constitutes the bulk of future commitments set aside in the reserves. As the majority of policyholders are relatively young today, the amount set aside has been increasing,"" he said. Dr Koh added that other such commitments include diseases currently under treatment that will require long-term care, such as renal failure and cancer. Providing figures in Parliament, Dr Koh said a total of S$7.5 billion in premiums were collected between 2016 and 2019. This comprised S$4.4 billion collected from policyholders, and S$3.1 billion from the Government in terms of subsidies and other forms of premium support. In this same period, S$3.5 billion in claims were paid out, while S$3 billion was set aside for future premium rebates. The Incurred Loss Ratio of the fund was an average of 104 per cent over the period from 2016 to 2019. ""This means that the total premiums collected were slightly less than the total monies required to ensure that the fund is able to meet current claims and future commitments,"" said Dr Koh. He stressed that the fund has to be \u201cself-sustaining\u201d and based on \u201csound actuarial principles\u201d. ""Premiums collected have to cover potential current and future payouts, including amounts set aside to support future commitments as well as provide a buffer against unforeseen contingencies such as unexpected spikes in hospitalizations due to disease outbreaks,"" he added. COMPUTING PREMIUM INCREASES Several MPs raised questions relating to how premium increases are computed. In response to PAP MP Foo Mee Har\u2019s question on whether the Ministry of Health would \u201citemise\u201d factors contributing to the premium increase, Dr Koh said that it is difficult to predict the technology driving clinical practice. In the past, a head injury would only warrant an X-ray of the skull, which costs about S$15 to S$20. But now, barely 20 years later, CT scans are required for head injuries, which can cost \u201chundreds of dollars\u201d, he said. \u201cSo as opposed to a transport fair formula where the parameters and variables are a little bit more fixed and more predictable, healthcare inflation takes into account many unforeseen kind of variables that will come along the way,\u201d he said. While it will be hard to have a single formula with \u201cthat level of clarity\u201d, actuaries that use current data to project will make adjustments over time, and this is why the Government has to review premiums on a regular basis, he added. WP MP Gerald Giam reiterated his question on whether the Government would make the full MediShield Life actuarial report available, for the sake of transparency. Dr Koh said MediShield Life premiums are proposed and calculated by external actuaries who are independent from the Government. The size of the funds, the amount collected and the amount paid out are also externally audited and the report will later be submitted to Parliament on an annual basis, he added. However, Dr Koh acknowledged that the Government may have to have a \u201cbetter system\u201d of looking at how the assumptions and calculations need to evolve. \u201cOver time, we could perhaps engage different consultants to take a look, to challenge the assumptions, to do another calculation at an appropriate time, to make sure that we are still on track,\u201d he said. He added that ministry would speak to consultants on publishing some of the data \u201cin an academic way\u201d, but emphasised that it will \u201cnot be something that most laypeople will understand\u201d.",2020-11-02T20:27:29,MediShield Life

In a joint statement on Thursday, SLA and the Housing Board, which currently manages these spaces, said that the move will allow for greater administrative and operational efficiency. SLA currently manages state land plots outside of public housing estates, such as empty spaces under viaducts, as well as fields near Haw Par Villa MRT station and Dover Road. With the handover, SLA will issue temporary occupation licences needed for the use of state land in public housing estates, and handle the maintenance and feedback. Temporary occupation licences are required when these spaces are used for religious and community events, as well as for community gardens. The agencies said that HDB currently manages and maintains about 1,408ha of state land within public housing estates and manages about 600 temporary occupation licences. \u201cAll key terms and conditions of licences or tenancy agreements issued by HDB and prevailing as of the transfer date will remain unchanged,\u201d said HDB and SLA. They added that \u201cthe public can be assured that the transition of the management agency will be seamless\u201d. Before March 1, licensees and tenants can continue to approach HDB for help on matters relating to their temporary occupation licences and day-to-day operations. For inquiries on matters relating to the transfer, licensees and tenants can call HDB on 6490-3177, or submit a request through www.hdb.gov.sg/efeedback From March 1, all new temporary occupation licence applications for the use of vacant state land within HDB estates will be handled by SLA, and applications may be submitted at https://app1.sla.gov.sg/tol Those who wish to check if a site is state land can do so using the LandQuery feature at www.onemap.gov.sg , while feedback on municipal issues can continue to be submitted through the OneService App.",2023-01-19T20:22:02,occupation mobility

It is a verbal agreement by the bank, showing the amount they are potentially prepared to lend to you, based on your financial ability and the credit history. It is not a gurantee, but it do help customer to gauge the range that the bank is able to finance them and to choose a property of that range. 2) Does all bank give the same amount for AIP/IPA? No, different bank set different criteria. It varies throughout the banks. 3) What is the difference between Repricing and refinancing? Repricing mainly is to negotiate a better rate within the same bank while refinancing is to switch a bank for a better rate 4) What is the difference between going straight to the bank and getting a mortgage broker to serve me? There are more than 10 banks / Financial Institute in Singapore, 0.10% - 0.2% makes  a difference on the interest you paid yearly. If Bank A only sell Sibor package, Banker A will tell you that Sibor Package is best and others cant fight them . For Mortgage Broker, we consolidate rates from almost all banks in Singapore , source the best rate for you and tailor it to suits your risk level. Moreover, we do quaterly / half yearly review on customer package to determine if they require a switch of bank. 5) Do we have to pay mortgage broker for their service? Most bank renumerate brokers for their service and normally broker service are FREE (unless otherwise stated) 6) Since the bank is paying Mortgage Broker , will Mortgage Broker still source us the Best rate in the Market? Mortgage Broker are renumerate based on a percentage of the loan, getting you the best package wont affect their commission, so in order to get more repeat customer and referrals, Mortgage Broker will source you the best rates, based on your risk taking level. 6) What are the basic documentation required for a financing of property?

Hence, one can imagine how much harder it\u2019d be if you don\u2019t have one, or worse, have one that\u2019s unaccredited. This was the plight of one Malaysian man who completed a five-year degree programme at a Johor college, only to find out the certificate is unrecognised in Malaysia and Singapore. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISING Source: Sin Chew Daily on YouTube As a result, he was only able to rely on his secondary school certificate to find jobs, thus limiting his career options. Man paid S$5.1k for 5-year degree programme at Johor college\u200b The Malaysian man, Mr Teng (transliterated from Mandarin), told his story via a press conference in Johor yesterday (10 Mar). He decided to publicise his struggles in order to raise awareness and prevent others from falling into the same trap. It all started in 2010 when he was introduced by a friend to the college, according to Sin Chew Daily . Hailing from a poverty-stricken background, the supposedly discounted programme fees and flexibility to work while taking classes enticed him to sign up. ADVERTISEMENT Five years and S$5,104 (RM17,000) later, he graduated with what he thought was an accredited bachelor\u2019s degree. Source: Sin Chew Daily He found out the hard way when a bank that hired him as a financial analyst informed him that his degree was unrecognised. Subsequently, the bank rescinded their job offer. ADVERTISEMENT Man took up various jobs in security & call centres in Singapore\u200b Next, Mr Teng took up the matter with the college but claimed that they did not only give a reasonable response but also threatened to sue for defamation. In the eight years that have passed since graduating, he said he has sought help from the Malaysian police, consumer tribunal, and Ministry of Higher Education (MOE) Malaysia \u2014 all to no avail. As a result, he had no other academic qualifications to fall back on except his secondary school certificate. With that, he took up various jobs in Singapore, including as a security guard and call centre operator. He felt like he had hit rock bottom during this time, and even contemplated taking his own life. Additionally, Mr Teng shared that he had to switch jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic. The difficulty of finding work then made him realise more than ever the importance of having a degree. Starting over in a business administration course\u200b Eventually, Mr Teng decided to give higher education another shot with the encouragement of friends and family. While he faced some roadblocks at first, he was able to apply with his years of work experience later on. Since April last year, he has been taking remote classes for a business administration course from a UK-based university. He is now on track to complete his studies next year. Following the reopening of the Malaysia-Singapore borders, he has also quit his job here and returned to his hometown of Johor. Public advised to check institution\u2019s qualifications before enrolling\u200b According to Mr Teng, he had approximately 10 other coursemates who went through the same ordeal. Malaysian Member of Parliament (MP) Jimmy Puah stated during the press conference that colleges cannot issue bachelor degrees of their own.

Mr Puah went on to say that scams like this usually target individuals who wish to work while studying, and lure them with discounted programme fees. He advised secondary school graduates to check an institution\u2019s qualifications via MOE Malaysia before enrolling.

He will not be permitted to practise as a dentist in Singapore for at least three years. After this period, he can apply for his name to be restored in the register, said the Singapore Dental Council in a statement on Friday (June 25). Last year, Teo became the first person to be jailed for cheating the Government through the Community Health Assist Scheme (Chas). He was sentenced to 46 weeks' jail after being convicted for 25 charges of making false Chas claims. These claims were for dental procedures between 2014 and 2015. Teo's actions caused two polyclinic groups - SingHealth Polyclinics and National Healthcare Group Polyclinics - that process and reimburse Chas claims on behalf of the Ministry of Health to wrongfully disburse more than $18,000. On Friday, the Singapore Dental Council said it held on April 12 a disciplinary inquiry against Teo, who previously practised at Phoenix Dental Surgery clinics. The disciplinary committee noted that Teo's dishonest conduct and convictions seriously impinged upon the reputation of the profession. As Teo's case was apparently the first to be brought before the disciplinary committee, it was imperative to set the appropriate benchmark in emphasising that such cases must be dealt with severely, said the council. Teo has been ordered to pay the costs and expenses of, and incidental to, the proceedings, including costs of counsel to the Singapore Dental Council. His removal from the Register of Dentists took effect on Wednesday (June 23). The council urged all dental professionals to be cognisant of the laws and regulations governing dental practices. It added that professionals should comply with the provisions of the code of ethics of the profession as well as directives and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health.

Wealthy people and corporates can go anywhere. Our electorate is increasingly becoming little islanders, all wrapped up in a delusional bubble.

Patients in hospital are supported by existing healthcare subsidies and the MediShield Life, MediSave and MediFund schemes. Patients can use MediSave for treatment and hospitalisation, and MediFund can help those who are unable to use MediSave or have difficulty paying the $700 bill, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam told Parliament on Friday. The same financial schemes apply for those who are admitted to the intensive care unit, which is rarer now for those infected with Covid-19, she added. \u201cIt is noteworthy that after three years of the pandemic, the vast majority of Covid-19 patients experience mild symptoms and are not expected to require hospital admission,\u201d she noted. Ms Rahayu was responding to Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), who asked about Covid-19 treatment costs, assistance for those diagnosed with long Covid, and additional healthcare subsidies available. On Feb 9, it was announced that treatment and testing for the coronavirus will no longer be fully subsidised from April as the country shifted to Dorscon green, making Covid-19 no longer a special category of disease. Covid-19 vaccination under the National Vaccination Programme will remain free as it is the first line of defence. Oral antivirals will remain fully subsidised for eligible patients in outpatient settings and nursing homes, until further notice. Patients who visit polyclinics with symptoms will be charged about $20 to $35 after subsidies, similar to what patients with other acute respiratory diseases are charged, said Ms Rahayu. Doctors will treat Covid-19 patients based on their assessment and how severe the symptoms are, similar to the way they approach patients with other diseases. Patients with prolonged symptoms or long Covid will be cared for and supported in the same way as those experiencing lingering effects of other respiratory diseases, Ms Rahayu added. Covid-19 patients in C-class wards to pay about $700 from April 1 Patients can use MediSave for their treatment and hospitalisation, and there is MediFund to help those unable to use MediSave.

The exchange is interesting both for the wild pro-US bias shown by a UN official, and for the way it illustrates how much truth can be exposed when journalists do what they're supposed to do in the press gallery. Xu, who has done on-the-ground reporting in Syria in the past, asked Haq some challenging questions about an attack on a US military base in eastern Syria last week which injured multiple American troops and killed an American contractor. In his response, Haq made the extremely incorrect claim that there are no US armed forces in Syria, and refused to say whether the US military occupation of part of the country is illegal. Here's the UN's transcript of the key part of this exchange (emphasis added by me): Xu: Do you not urge everyone to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria? Haq: Well of course, that's a given, and obviously it's important that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria is respected. At the same time you are aware of the complexity of the situation of foreign forces, but we call for them to exercise restraint. Xu: But, do you think the presence of the US military in Syria is illegal or not? Haq: That's not an issue that we're dealing with at this stage. There's been a war. Xu: But, is that\u2026 because it sounds very familiar this week. We talk a lot about the UN Charter, the international law and relative resolutions.  But, it sounds to me, a foreign ministry based presence in another country without invitation, sounds like something else to me. Haq: I'll leave your analysis to you.  That there's\u2026 At this stage there's no\u2026 Xu: What's the difference between the situation in Syria and the situation in Ukraine? Haq: There's no US armed forces inside of Syria.  And so I don't have a\u2026 It's not a parallel situation to some of the others. Xu: You're sure there's no US military personnel in Syria? Haq: I believe there's military activity.  But, in terms of a ground presence in Syria, I'm not aware of that. Xu: Okay.  Five US service members were injured in that attack.  If there were no US service members in Syria, how could they got injured?  That's weird, right?  Should I ask you about that?  And by the way, if you're talking about the resolution, the international law here is the resolution from Security Council 2254 (2015), I believe, it says in its PA [preambular] paragraph, \u201creaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations\u201d. Haq: Yes.  I'm aware of that.  And as you see, that is accepted by the members of the Security Council itself. Xu: Yeah.  So, again, back to my question, is that illegal to have presence in Syria for the US base, according to the relevant resolution that I just read out? Haq: The relevant resolution does call for that and we call on all countries to respect that.  I wouldn't go beyond that at this stage.",2023-03-29T21:56:49,occupation mobility

Failure rate always around 20% (about 4 to 5 person) per cohort. Click to expand... 2) Kyoji83 said: Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for Registered Nurses is a 2 years Full Time course for Singaporean & PR to be bond them for 3 years as Registered Nurse upon graduating from Diploma(Nursing). You will only see the Contract after signing Letter of Undertaking for $1K of Liquidated Damages (LD)if you decided not to take up PCP sponsorship after NYP offer you a seat. ----------------------------------------------------------- This is the estimated Estimated amount of liquidated damages upon signing deed (Training allowance is $1,900 per month upon signing deed) 1st year = (Course Fees for 1st year + Training Allowance for 1st year + $150.00 uniform) x 110% = ($39,782.60# + $22,800.00 + $150.00) x 110% = $69,005.86 2nd year = (LD of first (1st) year + Course Fees for 2nd year + Training Allowance for 2nd year (to 5th year) + One-Time Career Transition Bonus) x 110% = ($69,005.86 + $39,782.60# + $22,800.00 + $2,000.00) x 110% = $146,947.31 However there is an increment of allowance from $1,900 to $2,050. So now the new estimated amount of liquidated damages is: 1st year = (Course Fees for 1st year + Training Allowance for 1st year + $150.00 uniform) x 110% \t= ($39,782.60# + $24,600.00 + $150.00) x 110% = $70,985.86 2nd year = (LD of first (1st) year + Course Fees for 2nd year + Training Allowance for 2nd year (to 5th year)\t+ One-Time Career Transition Bonus) x 110% = ($70,985.86+ $39,782.60# + $24,600.00 + $2,000.00) x 110% = $151,105.31 * Remark: Depending on sponsoring hospital, some will included medical checkup & injection fees for DL. For this computation of LD is without it. ----------------------------------------------------------- Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) stated that total liquidated damages (including full course fees, training allowances and career transition bonus) at the point of training completion could amount to roughly be $125,000 which is not the true facts! I suspected that NYP give to WDA, Ministry of Health (MOH), MOH Holdings (MOHH) and sponsoring hospitals a estimated course fees of $39,782.60 per year to draft sponsorship contract. After NYP decided to charge $34,475.40 that year without allowing student to have Subsidy like MOE*Tuition*Grant to  sponsoring hospital. Normally, a seller will give a price for the product to be consider by the buyer. However I am surprise why this work another way when the buyers (WDA, MOH, MOHH and sponsoring hospitals) willing to buy the product before the seller (NYP) even give the actual price. During that year, Full time 3 years normal Diploma courses for Singaporean is $19,881.60, PR is $22,695.70 & International Students is $26,218.70 as Non*subsidised*Student for that year. So why did NYP charge a high price of $34,475.40 or unacceptable purchasing procedures without anyone like Auditor General's Office (AGO) questioning? To add on, why Singaporeans & PRs are not given Tuition Grant for studying full-time Diploma in Nursing (PCP)? ----------------------------------------------------------- I have actually ask FTs who are under sponsorship for 3 years normal Diploma courses & their reply is they do not know their actual amount for LD. Their surety are FTs who mostly like their parent in their home country like China. If they run away, by right Singapore Government (sponsors) needs to engage Lawyer at China to demand for DL payment. However I never hear any sponsors doing that. For PCP, there is no way to run cause both student & surety are local.

There are a lot of PCP students/graduates regret signing up. ----------------------------------- Addition Information to those who are interested about salary package & career advancement for PCP-RN 1) You will only know your basic salary when they offered an employment contract after you graduate from Diploma. 2) Sponsoring hospital claim that your non-relevant or relevant experience, Nursing School results & etc will be a factor to be consider into deciding your salary package. 3) Our sources from my seniors & their seniors is basic salary will be S$2,300 & those who serve NS will be S$2,500 regardless of what spell out in point 2. Same route of advancement as normal diploma holders but high expectation because we are mid-career switch. As mature 'Fresh RN' who have many years of non-relevant experience in workforce, we tend to be able to perform better compare to Fresh RN teenagers that make it look like we have 'fast tread career advancement' which is not true. Click to expand... 5) Kyoji83 said: Not ready to share but as you read on, you may guess something. 1) PCP students may left school many years & have family commitment compare to full time students. 2) If Lecturers, Assessors and course materials from NYP are not consistent. 3) While full time student are taking around 5 core modules per semester, PCP student are taking 9 core modules per semester. 4) Full time student trained in Nursing Lab 1A & attend Clinical Placement 1A in semester 1 & they will take Nursing Lab 1B & attend Clinical Placement 1B in semester 2. PCP student trained in only Nursing Lab 1A but attended Clinical Placement 1A & partial 1B in semester 1. In short, PCP student are assess in Clinical Placement when they are not trained but during pre-Clinical Placement briefing, student are told not to perform skills if you are not trained. 5) It is up to Assessor to ask any questions (could be from other modules like Human Bioscience) for Nursing Lab test that is not taught in Nursing Lab by Lecturers and not shown in course materials. 6) Full time student have around 40 students in a class while my PCP class have only 25 students. During Nursing Lab Test, Assessor tend to give more chance to full time students by clearing them faster such asking easiler or less questions & move on if student unable to answer. 7) If Lecturers want to play you out, they will not be consistent with course materials by omitting or adding non-relevant information, procedure not in sequence & etc to your practicing/sub-group in Nursing Lab Test. 8) A Nursing Lab Test maybe 1 hour test with 2 skills (about 30 minutes per skill). Assessor can play you out by starting the test time but stop you from doing the skills until you answer all Assessor's questions in order to be 'safe' that can last up to 30 minutes or more which mean you will know that you will fail the test at that time. 9) When NYP Lecturers feel that you cannot perform, some of them will start to tort you by verbal and emotional abuse to affect your mental health. They will keep harassing you by stressing the increasing huge amount of liquidated damages when you stay longer in a course and keep asking you when you intend to quit.

Click to expand... 7) Kyoji83 said: All full time courses in public schools like ITE, Polytechnic & University have the same time for school holiday. That is the time where commander will consider to schedule ICT for NSmen reservist. However for PCP student, we start 2 weeks earlier compare to Full time student. We only have 2 weeks school holiday after our Clinical Placement which is the end of semester. So NSmen will have problem for their ICT cause NYP only give you deferment letter but it is up to your NS unit to approve the deferment. My classmates & my seniors were lucky to be SPF NSmen. They will received their estimated ICT schedule long before they received their NP76 for SPF NSmen (SAF100 for SAF & SCDF100 for SCDF NSmen). So they can make arrangement to reschedule their ICT during school holiday for PCP student. So for those who want to sign up for PCP, better think twice because reservist is a liability for PCP student & you do not want this to be the cause of your liquidated damages.

They were speaking to The Straits Times on 2022 household income figures released by the Singapore Department of Statistics (SingStat) on Thursday. Median monthly household income from work rose 0.2 per cent in real terms, or after adjusting for inflation, in 2022. This is lower than the 1.5 per cent increase registered in 2021. After adjusting for inflation, households in the first nine deciles saw real income growth. Only the top decile saw a drop in real income. Asked why this is so, analysts said the highest income group could be most affected by high inflation, as they spend more on big-ticket items such as cars, air tickets and private properties. Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the National University of Singapore Business School\u2019s Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said top income earners are usually professionals whose incomes are subject to variations due to the economic situation, which has not been favourable in recent years. \u201cIt is normally more difficult to sustain the high bases in income as one goes up the earnings ladder,\u201d he added. Experts said cost of living remains a concern, especially for middle-income households. The fall in income inequality, they added, showed that Government measures to uplift the lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Model and Workfare Income Supplement scheme have been effective. Income inequality is also moderated by government transfers. Government job and wage support schemes during the pandemic allowed lower income earners to maintain their pay or even keep their jobs, said Prof Loh. After adjusting for government transfers and taxes, the Gini coefficient in 2022 fell from 0.437 to 0.378. This compares favourably with some developing nations, which have a Gini coefficient of around 0.6, said NUS sociology professor Tan Ern Ser. But a look at wealth inequality may present a different picture, he added. Wealthier individuals may have income from sources other than employment, such as investments, property and inherited wealth, which are not accounted for in SingStat data. CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the increase in real household incomes showed that the post-Covid-19 re-opening of the economy has created more opportunities, with the labour market tightening significantly. To further narrow the income gap in the long run, higher wages and quality jobs would help the lowest earners. He said that while inflation remains high, it may have peaked in 2022. \u201cInflation becomes a concern only when it becomes entrenched, and expectations for inflation continue to rise and outstrip nominal wage growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do see this... where we have supply disruptions and various issues like the Ukraine war, but it looks like the worst of inflation may be behind us.\u201d OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said: \u201cInflation may not ease significantly this year, at least not in the first half of the year, especially for core inflation, so both nominal and real wage income growth may remain muted. \u201cFor households, especially middle income ones, they will likely still feel the pain from being squeezed by higher prices for most goods and services, as well as higher debt servicing burdens due to rising interest rates.\u201d She added that nominal wage growth may not keep pace with inflation in 2023, with headline and core inflation likely to come in at around 6 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. But, she observed, unemployment rates are very low and employment gains jumped in 2022.

Recently, I took my 19-year-old daughter who had a fever of 37.8 deg C to Bukit Batok Polyclinic and was told to queue for a time slot to see the doctor. But we ended up not getting a time slot because my daughter was not considered a priority case, as she was neither a child nor an elderly person running a high fever. While I acknowledge the need for prioritisation in a busy healthcare system, I am concerned that this may prevent people from accessing the healthcare they need, particularly for minor illnesses that could escalate into more serious conditions. For many families, polyclinics may be their only option for healthcare, and not getting treatment could have dire consequences. In my recent experience, being in the queue for nearly an hour before being told we would not get to see the doctor was frustrating. Many Singaporeans, like myself, have employee benefits at polyclinics that can help defray the cost of healthcare. Even with the Community Health Assist Scheme benefit, private healthcare costs are still higher than those for public healthcare. Policies on public healthcare accessibility at polyclinics should be reviewed to ensure that everyone can receive timely and appropriate care.

The net result is that locals can take on the jobs at \u201cslightly higher levels\u201d , Dr Tan said, citing findings from internal studies by his ministry on foreign workforce policies. \u201cThis has therefore informed our approach of remaining open to high quality foreign professionals while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of Work Permit holders through quotas and also levies,\u201d he said. However, there is a limit to how much the government can tighten access to lower-skilled foreign workers, due to the size of Singapore\u2019s population, Dr Tan pointed out. Continuing to do so would have a \u201cworse-off\u201d effect on Singapore\u2019s economic progress and industry development, he added. Noting that the same correlation of tightening foreign worker access and improving local employment does not apply at higher skill levels, Perera asked if this meant that Singapore is not producing enough highly skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating. Disagreeing, Dr Tan said: \u201cWe are already doing significantly more to improve on the prospects in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, in the upskilling, in upgrading.\u201d But accelerating changes have forced economies and industries to evolve rapidly, alongside other significant disruptions, he said. \u201cTo keep pace with those and to keep ahead pre-emptively, in terms of making sure that we\u2019re ahead of the competition, we will not just need to develop our own local talent, we will also need foreign workers to come alongside with us and complement us as we move forward.\u201d Dr Tan noted however that the studies \u201care but just one input to the entire policymaking process\u201d, adding that they have their limitations. \u201cFor example, they are unable to account for less quantifiable effects of having foreigners in our workplace and our workforce, such as the knowledge spillovers to locals and other network effects,\u201d he said. This means the impact of the interventions studied might also change if they are applied beyond a certain scale or at a different time period. The studies need to be interpreted carefully with other sources of information, including more recent labour market statistics and industry feedback, he said. https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/si...rkers-more-likely-improve-job-outcomes-locals",2023-02-27T13:29:15,access to healthcare

A local survey published last month found that the median gross monthly salary of last year's graduates had shot up from S$3,800 in 2021 to S$4,200 (US$2,860 to US$3,160). This was a sharp spike compared with previous years, where median salaries for fresh graduates typically increased by S$100 each year. One mechanical engineering graduate, who took up an operations role in the automotive industry, told CNA that his starting pay was S$3,500 \u2013 well below last year's median salary of S$4,600 for those in the engineering cluster. The 26-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Lewis, graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in May last year. His current job was one of three offers he received within a month of applying for jobs after graduating in May last year. The other two had offered a slightly higher pay of S$3,600 but he eventually settled for his current role due to the company\u2019s reputation and the prospect of receiving bonus payouts of up to six months. Based on his knowledge of the company's typical salary increments, he estimated that his salary would increase by about 5 per cent following his performance appraisal. While this will bump his salary up to S$3,675, it would still be lower than last year\u2019s median pay for his sector. \u201cI do feel a bit left out,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut at this juncture of my career, I\u2019m still very much learning and so my focus isn\u2019t really about how much I\u2019m making, but rather the exposure and experience I\u2019m getting."" Another fresh graduate, who received his degree in information systems from the National University of Singapore (NUS) last May, was offered S$5,200 for a software developer role. The 27-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Keith, successfully negotiated a higher pay of S$5,500. Despite this, his salary is still lower than the median starting pay of S$5,625 for those in the information and digital technologies cluster. But not all graduates from the Class of 2022 have managed to land a job. Another NUS graduate, who received her degree in psychology with a minor in communications and new media in December, is still unemployed and on the search for a full-time job. The 24-year-old, who wanted to be known as Eunice, told CNA she applied for 60 to 70 jobs in various industries since the start of the year but few have responded. \u201cI\u2019m casting my net wide and applying for roles that seem interesting to me, so I have been looking at entry-level and associate roles that suit my skills or are in companies that I really like,\u201d she said.

Special consideration should be given to such workers during these challenging times, stressed the National Wages Council (NWC), in releasing an addendum to its guidelines on Friday (May 14). Employers that have done well or are recovering from the pandemic can consider built-in wage increments to boost the wages of these workers, it added. NWC intends to incorporate the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers that will be released later this year, into its own guidelines. The work group, formed last October, is studying how to increase the wages of more low-income workers and improve their well-being, beyond existing measures. The Singapore National Employers Federation said in a statement that the recommendation to give special consideration to low-wage workers ensures that they are able to ""benefit from economic recovery and growth"". ""In the event that their employers are still not doing well, the recommendation would then mitigate the economic impact on them,"" noted the federation. It added that the ongoing pandemic has highlighted how some front-line low-wage workers, particularly those serving in sectors such as cleaning and security, have been working harder to keep the country safe. National Trades Union Congress president Mary Liew also urged employers to pay their staff an annual wage supplement, as this would go towards retaining talent and better position companies for recovery. The annual wage supplement ""will also help our workers during this challenging period with their seasonal expenses, and this is especially helpful for our low-wage workers"", she added.

They were speaking to The Straits Times on 2022 household income figures released by the Singapore Department of Statistics (SingStat) on Thursday. Median monthly household income from work rose 0.2 per cent in real terms, or after adjusting for inflation, in 2022. This is lower than the 1.5 per cent increase registered in 2021. After adjusting for inflation, households in the first nine deciles saw real income growth. Only the top decile saw a drop in real income. Asked why this is so, analysts said the highest income group could be most affected by high inflation, as they spend more on big-ticket items such as cars, air tickets and private properties. Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the National University of Singapore Business School\u2019s Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said top income earners are usually professionals whose incomes are subject to variations due to the economic situation, which has not been favourable in recent years. \u201cIt is normally more difficult to sustain the high bases in income as one goes up the earnings ladder,\u201d he added. Experts said cost of living remains a concern, especially for middle-income households. The fall in income inequality, they added, showed that Government measures to uplift the lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Model and Workfare Income Supplement scheme have been effective. Income inequality is also moderated by government transfers. Government job and wage support schemes during the pandemic allowed lower income earners to maintain their pay or even keep their jobs, said Prof Loh. After adjusting for government transfers and taxes, the Gini coefficient in 2022 fell from 0.437 to 0.378. This compares favourably with some developing nations, which have a Gini coefficient of around 0.6, said NUS sociology professor Tan Ern Ser. But a look at wealth inequality may present a different picture, he added. Wealthier individuals may have income from sources other than employment, such as investments, property and inherited wealth, which are not accounted for in SingStat data. CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the increase in real household incomes showed that the post-Covid-19 re-opening of the economy has created more opportunities, with the labour market tightening significantly. To further narrow the income gap in the long run, higher wages and quality jobs would help the lowest earners. He said that while inflation remains high, it may have peaked in 2022. \u201cInflation becomes a concern only when it becomes entrenched, and expectations for inflation continue to rise and outstrip nominal wage growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do see this... where we have supply disruptions and various issues like the Ukraine war, but it looks like the worst of inflation may be behind us.\u201d OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said: \u201cInflation may not ease significantly this year, at least not in the first half of the year, especially for core inflation, so both nominal and real wage income growth may remain muted. \u201cFor households, especially middle income ones, they will likely still feel the pain from being squeezed by higher prices for most goods and services, as well as higher debt servicing burdens due to rising interest rates.\u201d She added that nominal wage growth may not keep pace with inflation in 2023, with headline and core inflation likely to come in at around 6 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. But, she observed, unemployment rates are very low and employment gains jumped in 2022.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - With the world facing a water crisis, Singapore must not take what it has for granted as clean, fresh water is a precious resource, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Saturday. He was speaking at the Singapore World Water Day (SWWD) celebrations held at Marina Barrage and organised by the Public Utilities Board (PUB). Also present were Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, and Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor. Mr Wong said that billions of people around the world struggle to get enough water, and within Asia, hundreds of millions still do not have access to clean and safe drinking water. The problem is likely to get worse, with experts expecting global demand for fresh water to outstrip the supply of fresh water by 40 per cent by the end of the decade due to over-depletion and mismanagement, he said. While the Republic\u2019s water situation has improved over the decades, more has to be done to ensure secure supplies for future demand, which is estimated to double over the next 30 years to meet growing population and economic needs, said Mr Wong. Meanwhile, he added, climate change is making the weather even more extreme and unpredictable all around the world. Singapore is seeing more intense rainfall, as well as more frequent and prolonged dry spells. It must therefore continue to plan ahead, build up its infrastructure, and invest in new technologies to build a sustainable water supply, he said. Mr Wong also recounted what his mother had told him about life in the 1950s and 60s. During a dry spell in 1963, water rationing was imposed for 10 months and water supply was cut off for as long as half a day, up to thrice a week. This prompted the Government to price water properly to discourage over-consumption, and provide the right incentives to develop additional sources of clean water, he said. He noted that apart from local catchment and imported water, Singapore now has NEWater and desalination \u2013 the \u201cfour national taps\u201d. He stressed the role of businesses and other organisations, which today take up more than half of Singapore\u2019s water demand and will rise to two-thirds by 2065. Over the years, he said, PUB has worked with businesses to implement water recycling projects and increase water efficiency. From 2024, PUB will introduce mandatory water recycling for new projects in water-intensive industries, such as the wafer fabrication, electronic, and biomedical sectors. SWWD participants The Straits Times spoke to stressed the importance of innovative solutions and public education. Ms Joelle Chen, head of Sustainability in Asia at Lendlease, said the shopping mall, Jem, has a condensate recovery system that captures water condensation from air-conditioner units in the mall, which would otherwise drip into the building\u2019s drainage system. The condensate water is used to chill the cooling towers. Lendlease also does rainwater harvesting at all its malls, and has daily meter readings to spot spikes in usage that may indicate a leak. Mr Marcus Lim, the co-founder of Ecosoftt, a company which helps buildings recycle water through \u201cminiaturised NEWater systems\u201d, said there is increasing interest from building and factory owners who want to reduce costs and meet environmental, social, and governance goals. He gave the example of a semiconductor company which it helped to save 450m3, which costs 2.33 per m3, checking out to over $1,000 of savings per day. The company also benefited from PUB\u2019s Industrial Water Solutions Demonstration Fund, which incentivises innovative projects to treat industrial used water for process reuse. Mrs Tan Sun Sun, principal of Mee Toh School, said the school\u2019s Primary 5 pupils learn about water sustainability by visiting the NEWater Visitor Centre and conducting interviews on water usage habits. They also design prototypes to recycle used water, as well as create posters and videos to promote water conservation. Ms Chong Mien Ling, PUB\u2019s chief sustainability officer, said schools also conduct annual water rationing exercises where students and teachers experience the inconvenience of not having clean running water from a tap. \u201cThis is to remind ourselves that we shouldn\u2019t take clean and reliable source of water for granted,\u201d she said. Concluding his speech, Mr Wong said that collective efforts have enabled Singapore to come this far in its Water Story, and the Singapore Story. \u201cLet us continue to walk this journey together as active participants in nation building and advocates for water conservation in Singapore, so that we can continue to overcome all sorts of challenges ahead, and enjoy good, clean water in Singapore for many more decades to come.\u201d",2023-03-18T16:10:10,central provident fund

The following are just my personal opinion. YMMV. 1) For existing users of any ISPs: no switching of ISP unless if you got issues or you got very good offers from the other ISPs. 2) Recommendation for new sign-up: M1 or Starhub 500Mbps or 1Gbps plan; avoid Singtel 1Gbps/2Gbps plan becuase of ONR. Singtel no longer entertains bridging request for 1Gbps plan since March 2022. Singtel 2Gbps plan will not allow ONR bridging at all. Number 1 plan to avoid is Singtel 2Gbps plan which is no better than Singtel 1Gbps plan for 99% of the use cases. It is also better to avoid Viewquest for new users due to stability issues unless you are a power user and you know what you are doing. Power users may like Viewquest due to the perceived higher performance. Viewquest is now using CGNAT as well but you can get static IP add-on (monthly subscription). MyRepublic is worth considering but take note of the CGNAT limitation (which can be easily mitigated by getting static IP at S$50 one time charge). Power users may consider MyRepublic due to perceived higher performance but there are recent negative feedbacks after Starhub takeover. Personal recommendation for average new subscribers and general use cases (no Starhub TV+ or Singtel TV services). Power users can ignore this recommendation. M1>= Starhub > MyRepublic (take note of the CGNAT thingy) > Singtel (not recommended because of ONR) > Whizzcomms (not recommended due to the fact that is get depriotized by Singtel when incidents happen) > Viewquest (not recommended becuase of stability concerns raised) 3) For existing Singtel ONR users (unbridged ONR 1Gbps), you may choose to stay if the limitation of the ONR does not bother you. If you feel the limitation then you may opt to move out. For existing Singtel ONT users for legacy plan and 1Gbps plan, you can keep the ONT upon recontract. However, please  take note you will be given ONR once you move to a new place. For existing bridged Singtel ONR users (bridged ONR for Singtel 1Gbps), you may need to contact Singtel before recontract to make sure they will keep the bridging status of your ONR before recontract. Most likely you can do that. 4) For Dual ISP users: M1+SH, M1+ MR, SH+MR and M1+MR are all good option to go.  M1+VQ or SH+VQ can be a good option as well since you can leverage the good performance of VQ for certain use cases. M1+WC or SH+WC can be considered as well as long as you ask WC to configure the ONR to ONT mode. 5)  DO NOT USE the FREE BUNDLED ROUTER as the base for choosing ISPs. In general, it is better to buy your own router as the free router is not really good. Or in some case, buy the higher end router from the ISP if it is a good deal (eg: M1 GT-AX6000 is a superb deal). But anyway, this is just my personal opionion and many are still using the free router as the base for choosing ISPs becuase they may rely on ISP to provide the technical support (even though the technical support is in general not good). ********************************* All the dual 1Gbps or 2Gbps plans from Singapore ISPs have the same limitation because of the use of GPON ONT. Download is up to 2Gbps combined, upload is up to 1Gbps. All the 1Gbps plans from Singapore ISPs have the same limitation because of the use of GPON ONT. Download is up to 1Gbps combined, upload is up to 1Gbps. Last time only MyRepublic has the lower upload limit at 500Mbps but that has been fixed recently. GPON: Theoreticaly max speed: 2.5 Gbit/s down, 1.25 Gbit/s up (ISPs can further limit the speed to 2Gbps download and 1Gbps upload) Starhub UltraSpeed (10Gbps trial) is using  XGS-PON ( theoretical max speed: 10Gbps download, 10Gbps upload). Singtel 10Gbps plan is using XG-PON ( theoretical max speed: 10Gbps download, 2.5Gbps upload) but will switch to XGS-PON in April 2023. ********************************* 1. SingTel : (1Gbps, 2Gbps, 1+1 Gbps Gamer plan, 10Gbps plan, also have legacy 500Mbps plan for existing users) Public IP: yes, no static add-on ONT users (existing 500Mbps and 1Gbps): 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), VLAN required ONT users (existing  legacy Unlimited 1Gbps Plan): 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), VLAN not required, no Singtel TV ONR users: 6rd IPv6 (not good performance), but you need to request from Singtel and it may not be easy SingTel provide same connection for Internet and Fibre TV, VLAN is needed. For ONR users, Vlan is handled by the ONR. SingTel 1+1Gbps plan, only use ONR. The ONR will be configured as three port unbridged ONR ports and one port bridged ONR port, the bridged port does not require VLAN. Certain users have asked Singtel to provide a special configuration for the ONR with the 1Gbps plan, three ports for SingTel TV only without internet access, one bridged ONR port which does not require VLAN. Note: Singtel has stopped to entertain ONR bridging request since March 2022. Avoid Singtel as an ISP in general unless you are fine with the super basic feature of the Singtel ONR (you can not even set up your own DNS server). Singtel 2Gbps plan: aggregated 2Gbps, must use Singtel ONR, not possible to bridge the ONR Note: avoid this plan as it offers practically benefits compared to 1Gbps plan for majority of the users. Singtel 10Gbps plan: use XG-PON ONR, 1 x 10G LAN port and 4 x 1G LAN ports. After April 2023, it will switch to better 10G-XGS-PON technology. Take not it is using ONR and you can not bridge the ONR. Strong point: very stable, may have some advantages in terms of routing to China and Europe. 2.

Starhub uses different ONT ports to deliver Fibre Internet (ONT Port 1) and Fibre TV if you are using the Fibre TV Set Top box (ONT Port 2). New Starhub TV+ box is different, it needs to be connected to the router. Starhub 2Gbps plan: ONT port 1 and ONT port 3 used to deliver 2x1Gbps connection, ONT port 2 for Starhub Fibre TV. Starhub UltraSpeed 10Gbps trial (fallback to 2Gbps plan if th trial failed). Please take not it is using XGS-PON ONR and you can not bridge the ONR. 3. M1 (500Mbps, 1Gbps plan and 2Gbps plan) Public IP, ONT, no vlan needed. Native dual stack IPv6. Customers can pay for Static IP add-on. M1 2Gbps plan: ONT port 1 and ONT port 2 used to deliver 2x1Gbps connection, 4. MyRepublic (200Mbps, 1Gbps and 1+1 Gbps plan). Using ONT Carrier Grade NAT, no public IP by default. You can pay one time charge of S$50 for the Static IP. No vlan needed. No IPv6. MR is perceived to have good speed and lower latency for some gamers but there are feedbacks of routing performance degradation after the takeover by Starhub. 5.Viewquest (500Mbps, 1Gbps, 2Gbps plan) 500Mbps/1Gbps plan: ONT or ONR (you can bridge) 2Gbps plan: ONR (2Gbps one network plan, aggregated 2Gbps plan similar to Singtel 2Gbps plan), you can not bridge the ONR. You need to pay for static IP add-on to get public IPv4 address. If not they started to use CGNAT like MyRepublic for new users. Existing users may have static IPv4 address for free. No IPv6. VQ is peceived to have good performance and lower latency for some gamers, but there are some staibity concerns based on the feedbacks from the VQ thread. 6. Whizcomms (300Mbps->500Mbps and 1Gbps plan) Public IP, no IPv6. Whizcomms provides ONR, but you can ask them to configure the ONR in ONT mode prior to installation without charges. No Vlan needed. 7. SIMBA (upcoming with 2.5Gbps plan at S$20 per month). SIMBA \u2013 formerly TPG Telecom SIMBA Mobile simba.sg Note: 1. Some people are worried about throttling of BT, here is the what I gathered, just for reference. Take note I myself support the throttling policy for BT. 1) Viewquest=MyRepublic (almost no throttling) > 2) M1 >=Starhub (a bit of throttling) > 3) SingTel (pretty heavy throttling) > Whizcomms (worst); throttling of BT and things like Google Drive Download 2.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com I am disappointed by Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh\u2019s call on Monday in Parliament for an English proficiency test to be conducted for new citizen applicants. I agree that new citizens must familiarise themselves with Singapore\u2019s history, culture and our way of living. But we must not presume that they need to be proficient in English to be able to integrate harmoniously into our society. Proficiency in English does not make anyone more Singaporean. My late parents were not born in Singapore. My mother spoke Hainanese, and my father did not understand Mandarin. They integrated fully and became full-fledged Singaporeans. In the later part of their lives, my parents were better able to understand the local languages and dialects. Yes, Singapore\u2019s working language is English. But we have four official languages \u2013 English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. It is human instinct to pursue greater freedom and a higher standard of living when one decides to migrate. That was why our forefathers came from overseas to pursue better opportunities in Singapore, and decided to stay on. The same goes for the present generation of new citizens. For them to decide to live here permanently, they must feel welcomed and believe that they, too, have a stake in making Singapore better and more liveable. Attracting potential new citizens to Singapore and encouraging them or their children to stay on is a pressing issue that should not be complicated with an English proficiency test.

There were no MRTs, many HDBs didn\u2019t even have lifts, and most people were making a few hundred dollars per month. The problem, in fact, was so significant that the authorities ran their now (in)famous campaign of \u201cStop-at-Two\u201d in the 1970s. In other words, Singaporeans used to have many children despite lack of government incentives, much lower economic status, and much poorer housing conditions than they do today.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com Forum: Insurance claims denied because minor conditions not disclosed PUBLISHEDJUL 17, 2021, 1:00 AM SGT FACEBOOKTWITTER Last October, I purchased a life protection policy and upgraded my hospitalisation plan to include coverage at private hospitals. In February, I was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. With affirmation from my financial adviser, I pursued treatment at a private practice. I began treatment and submitted my claims for my critical illness payout as well as my upgraded hospital plan's coverage. This hospitalisation coverage entitled me to claim 100 per cent of my pre-hospitalisation bills on top of the full sum assured from the life protection policy. Throughout, I held on to the assurance that my policy would ease my burdens, as my income was affected by my sickness. Five months later, the insurer rejected these claims, citing failure in disclosing my vertigo and asthma. These ailments occurred one or two years before I bought the policy, during separate one-time visits to the family clinic for dizziness and cough. I was not formally diagnosed, and I did not think these were conditions worth disclosing as there were no specialist referrals and the clinics deemed further examinations unnecessary. Hence, the insurer's reasoning baffled me. How could these two incidents alter my outcome? The insurer also took five months to process my claims instead of one to three months. I asked other insurers, who said such claims should take only up to a month to help clients in times of urgent need. I was left stranded with a whopping $100,000 in medical bills with an additional $150,000 potentially pending. After speaking to others, I realised there were many others who have fallen between the cracks and were denied adequate care by their insurer. Mismanagement of information can result in painful impacts on people's lives, and my wish is that we start valuing lives for what they are. Denise Ho Shi Yi",2021-07-22T10:58:30,health insurance

The government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are still working on the details of the SSB programme, and will release more information later. To improve the availability of corporate bonds to Singapore retail investors, MAS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) will also ease the financial and administrative costs for issuers seeking to tap the retail market, Mrs Teo said. Two new frameworks as well as a tax deduction have been proposed, and MAS and SGX are targeting to implement the proposals in the second quarter of 2015.

""When we first started looking at this phenomenon, it was way back in the late 1990s and 2000s when we saw the inflow of foreign brides. ""When we mentioned foreign brides (in the past), we thought of women with low socio-economic status from the region who enter into marriages because of their families' financial circumstances."" But she said that the demographic profile has changed over the past 20 years, with economic growth in the region bringing greater educational and economic opportunities in their home countries. Prof Straughan said the result is that foreign wives are better educated. Separately, the number of Singaporean men who are less educated and who may have difficulties finding a local wife has shrunk, she added. Social workers have long raised concerns over transnational marriages involving older and less educated Singaporean men marrying young foreign women after a brief courtship. Foreign brides who marry S'poreans are getting older and more educated: MSF data Two in three have post-secondary or university education, according to government data released for the first time.

First, for the beneficiaries who is eligible / can qualify for this: Any Singaporean family with a child younger than 21 years old and live in HDB 4-room flat or below with no other property or overseas asset. Combined family assets (excluding valuation of HDB flat) should not exceed SGD $1 million. 2. For Donors, 3 entry points: For high income donors that already reside in Singapore, all your monetary contribution will count as donation and earn 2.5x income tax rebate. For high networth donors, your monetary contribution will count as donation but earn 1.5x valuation rebate towards your asset tax (e.g. property tax) For foreigners seeking citizenship in Singapore, as long you maintain at least 5 adoptee /beneficiary families for 10 years, you will be granted citizenship. 3. Rules & How it works: Any Singaporean / PR family who is eligible (see point 1) can apply to relevant ministry (in this case should be MCYS) here-forth stated as ""RM"" for such a adoption scheme. Donors cannot choose the families and vice versa to avoid abuse. Families are paired to donors by RM staff / counselors. Donors can have unlimited amount of adoptees/beneficiaries provided they show proof that they can support that many beneficiaries. (e.g. bank statement, assets pledged to the RM) RM will hold first joint meeting session to introduce the donor to the family. They will build rapport and family explain what they lack (e.g. not enough money for tuition, husband jobless, wife jobless, etc. etc.) Counselor will come up with targeted plan to help the family and provide family with a special debit card. This debit card can only be used for approved spending (e.g. pay tuition fees, etc etc.) Donor will provide a monthly/quarterly/annual contribution as agreed upon with counselor at the first meeting. For simplicity sake, the tax deduction amount will be calculated by contribution according to calendar year (i.e. 1/1 to 31/12). Amounts contributed after the year will be counted in subsequent year. Donor cannot over/under contribute. If they want to adjust the amount, they need to speak to the counselor. If donor lapse for 3 months (i.e. didn't contribute), they will be dropped from the programme and have to pay penalty of $10,000 or 10x their original contribution whichever higher. They will also be banned from this programme. For foreigners seeking citizenship, they will also be disqualified and banned from future schemes. For over-contribution, the amount will be refunded and banks / RM may charge a processing fee to the donor. Every period (e.g. monthly/ quarterly/ annually), the donor will meet with the adoptee/beneficiary to discuss their progress. Ultimately, the scheme should help to uplift the quality of life to the adoptee/beneficiary. For adoptee/beneficiary found to abuse the donations (e.g. use it to exchange for money and buy vices), they will be charged as fraud or under a new law with potential jail time. I believe this will help solve the wealth gap by bringing the super rich to the poor and have them communicate with each other. Some of the super rich are self-made and they can provide invaluable advise to the poor to help them uplift their lives. This will also reduce reliance on government as the main financial caretaker of the poor in Singapore while boosting our economy and attracting more wealth to Singapore.",2021-10-17T13:39:39,achievement gap

I was really surprised that they rejected to cover me even for emergency hospitalisations rather than exclude the condition only. So right now as a foreigner I'm stuck with no hospitalisation insurance which is really adding to my anxiety. Can the more experienced here suggest what other options I could try to atleast get cover for hospitalisation in case of accidents(serious, moderate or minor)? Moreover, what would happen if I didnt declare, had an expensive hospitalisation due to an accident/emergency at a restructured/public hospital and filed a claim? Lastly, would personal accident plans help in this situation? Thanks in advance!",2020-06-16T00:33:26,medical resources

To make it more convenient for aid seekers, those applying for ComCare's Short-To-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) scheme can also do so online at the SupportGoWhere portal in the coming months. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) announced these on Thursday (March 10) as part of its ongoing efforts to enable low-income families to get help more easily and in a shorter time. By the second quarter of this year, eligible families whose ComCare schemes are approved qualify automatically - without the need to apply - for the Ministry of Education's (MOE) Financial Assistence Scheme, which offers school fee waivers and transport subsidies, among other things, and the MSF's Student Care Fee Assistance scheme. The MSF also plans to let eligible ComCare families automatically enjoy the maximum fee subsidy for one year for children attending MSF-registered student-care centres or special student-care centres for those with disabilities. Up to 10,000 students are expected to benefit from these changes. ComCare is the Government's key social safety net. It provides short- to medium-term financial aid for low-income individuals and families in need, as well as long-term financial aid for the destitute who are permanently unable to work and have little or no family support. The MSF is also planning to progressively expand the number of schemes where ComCare applicants do not need to apply for separately, such as pre-school subsidies and housing and healthcare schemes, so that they can automatically get help from these other schemes if they get ComCare aid. For example, by the end of the year, eligible ComCare recipients will automatically get medical and dental subsidies at certain clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme. About 30,000 ComCare families are expected to enjoy greater convenience and a shorter wait before they get help from these schemes, in what the MSF describes as its bundling of help schemes. Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee said in the debate on the MSF's budget on Thursday (March 10) that there has been a ""deep shift"" in how the ministry delivers social services in the past few years. The focus is now on ""putting the family at the centre"" and meeting families' needs in a proactive and coordinated manner across different government and community agencies, instead of organising social services around programmes or agencies. He said: ""We call this our 3C approach... comprehensive in addressing presenting issues as well as deeper root causes; convenient support, so that families can focus their energies in improving their lives; and coordinated across different agencies and partners."" While those applying for ComCare's SMTA can do so online at the SupportGoWhere portal by the second quarter of the year, they can continue to do it in person too. Mr Lee said the portal - which consolidates information from different help schemes - will be improved so that users can check if they qualify for certain schemes, apply for aid directly and get updates on their application through a single platform. Over the next few years, the MSF will allow people to apply for more help schemes through the portal. In his speech, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli outlined the different policies the Government has put in place to improve the lives of Singaporeans and, in particular, the low-income groups, such as through ComCare and Workfare Income Supplement, which tops up the wages of lower-income workers. ""We must not allow inequality to become entrenched, as seen in most advanced economies. Going forward, addressing social needs will become even more complex,"" he said. Mr Masagos, Mr Lee and Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua also spoke about Community Link (ComLink), which provides comprehensive and coordinated support tailored to the needs of more than 14,000 families with children living in highly subsidised Housing Board rental flats. Mr Lee described ComLink as the MSF's flagship initiative of its 3C approach. Mr Masagos said the MSF and its partners, instead of waiting to be approached, seek out low-income families proactively to help them address their problems and to improve their lives through ComLink. Mr Chua said ComLink has reached out to more than 6,800 families since the programme started in 2019. Last year, the programme was rolled out in 11 towns and will be introduced nationwide for the remaining 10 towns in the coming months. One of its beneficiaries is housewife Norhamidah Mah Hassan, 29, whose family of seven receives $1,650 a month under ComCare's SMTA. Her husband is unable to work as he is unwell, and the couple have five children aged between three and nine. The family lives in a one-room rental flat. Madam Norhamidah, who is expecting her sixth child, said: ""Without ComCare, it will be very difficult for us and we have to borrow money from others."" Three of her children are on the MOE financial aid scheme and automatic qualification for the scheme for ComCare recipients like her helps save time and money, as she does not have to pay to photocopy the documents needed to apply for aid.",2022-03-10T23:20:14,Community Health Assit Scheme

Called Single Room Shared Facilities, this new housing type aims to give tenants greater privacy while providing a community-type living environment, said the Housing Board on Monday. HDB will pilot the initiative at the former Anderson Junior College hostel in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8, which comprises two 11-storey blocks. The site will be able to house 480 tenants in single rooms, fully partitioned out of 240 units. Each room, about 9 sq m, will come fitted with basic furnishings such a single-size bed frame, wardrobe, table, chair, wall shelves and a mini refrigerator. Tenants will have to buy their own mattress for hygiene reasons, said HDB. The 24 tenants on each level will share common facilities such as toilets, and kitchens equipped with five cooking stoves, sinks and cabinets. They will also share laundry and activity rooms, as well as dining areas repurposed from former study rooms. This set-up is unlike the Joint Singles Scheme Operator-Run model implemented in end-2021, which pairs singles to share a one- or two-room HDB flat which are semi-partitioned. Speaking to reporters after a tour of a sample unit, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the former hostel site was picked to reduce the preparation time to start the pilot as HDB could \u201cmake do with the existing infrastructure and make adjustments to it\u201d. \u201cIf we do make this a permanent feature of our rental flat offerings, there will be of course changes to the configurations and the ratio (of tenants to facilities). This is using existing infrastructure and making do with what we have to test out this model,\u201d he added. Mr Lee said the pilot will run for one to two years for HDB to collect data on whether the model will work, and if it should be included among the Government\u2019s public rental schemes. The former hostel site is currently still being fitted out, and singles will be able to apply individually in end-2023 when it is ready. The prevailing public rental eligibility criteria for singles will apply. An operator will be appointed to manage the site, including managing tenancy matters and providing social support, as well as furnishing and maintaining the premises, said HDB.

Spoiler: TLDR.. full story here.. Somehow this is a word that I never would have imagine that one day will have link/tagged to me. INSUBORDINATION . U all should know that bbfa are probably the most peace loving creature on earth, we normally don\u2019t fight since we can\u2019t win anyone in terms of being the favourites.. I also don\u2019t speak up either, everything we just swallow (don\u2019t think dirty) and by being on the rat race for such a long time, we all know that everyone is equal, but the truth is some are more equal than others So poor me had been doing two person role since the company M&A during covid period.. there\u2019s no increase in perks or anything, at least I got to keep my job despite not being the brightest star but I had been doing my work well and I\u2019m cheap to hire and keep la.. my manager also assured me certain agreements had been agreed and put in place that will make my work better and more smooth so two person workload is actually manageable or even less than before.. But in reality this isn\u2019t really the case and I had been suffering quite a lot over it all these one plus year but just sucked it up.. Recently the demands and standards got worse and my manager isn\u2019t even helping or on my side even.. all saving their own skin only.. So me decided to pluck out my one last courage and voice it out.. I emailed to the dept (cc Manager & Director) that\u2019s making my life terrible and in the email.. I am still being very polite no vulgarities, name shaming or finger pointing either. So I think I did a good job in describing the problem faced, how it could be better, suggesting solutions and highlighting the agreement in place. Though I agreed that with years of being on edmw, I had small mastery of how to scold a person without making myself ugly and remaining graceful.. all with the hope of they will at least show some face since I had brought up the matter and manager and director But somehow I think the ppl in the department I shooting at is the director favourite pet and somehow it shows the director sleeping on the job and incapable to manage its staff to allow this to happen.. Behind the scene I heard from my manager that the director proposed a urgent meeting with him to discuss over my email and the conclusion the director have is that my actions equates to insubordination and I could get myself fired. And today I received a email from HR first thing in the morning that they are holding a formal inquiry on the matter. and it seems like they are going down as insubordination. What do u think I should do? And am I really wrong? Will MOM be on my side? Does this justify for termination? Any advice greatly appreciated.. Thanks in advance.. Update 03/04/23: Not bumping this thread but rather updating the outcome on the first post.. As i want to see who really cares about me and bother to follow this thread.. Poll results 21-YES and 25-NO.. So i had the talk with HR, but they didn't really bring up the insubordination into the picture, so i also acted blur and remain quiet on my part of course. Maybe not to the extent of getting me fired so they rather dont touch on it but just give a verbal warning.. After all i had good performance all along and the feedback i had sent in the email is also for the general good, all facts anyway and im not the troublemaker to begin with.. though yes emotional and i should had went through the ""proper hierarchy even if it goes on deaf ears"" or i can always go to HR.. Was made to apologize to the director, other than that no official records left on my personnel booklet..

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE \u2013 Whenever retiree Tan Mui San goes to the supermarket, she will grab the free plastic bags to pack her groceries before loading them into her reusable shopping bag. \u201cUsing plastic bags from the supermarket to bag my refuse is an old habit which started decades ago, when we were encouraged to use plastic bags for throwing refuse into the rubbish chute,\u201d said the 70-year-old single. She would also offer the bags to her friends for the same purpose. But come July 3, when two-thirds of the supermarket outlets in Singapore start to charge at least five cents per plastic bag, she will stop taking such bags from the supermarkets, and instead buy them in bulk to bag her refuse. Madam Tan plans to switch to using only reusable bags when shopping, as will 42 per cent of respondents in a Milieu Insight survey. They said they will start bringing their own bags only from July 3. Of the 500 people who were surveyed on March 21 and 22, 67 per cent, or nearly seven in 10 shoppers, said they will use reusables at supermarkets from July, with 25 per cent of respondents already doing so now. The survey also saw 14 per cent of respondents who currently make physical visits to shops most of the time saying they will shop online for groceries more frequently as a result of the plastic bag charge. Milieu Insight said the change is likely due to the convenience. Of the 67 per cent of respondents who said they would bring their own bags from July, more than eight in 10 of them said they are nudged by the five-cent charge. This was also the case in other countries such as the United States and those in Europe, said Associate Professor Hannah Chang from the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University. \u201cImposing a small fee for each plastic bag is highly effective across consumer segments, irrespective of consumers\u2019 socio-economic characteristics,\u201d she said. But there will be shoppers who will continue to use supermarket plastic bags. Assistant Professor Charlene Chen of the Nanyang Business School at Nanyang Technological University said: \u201cPeople who purchase regularly will get desensitised to the pain of payment over time. If the payment remains minimal, they will remain desensitised. \u201cIncreasing the charge is a tricky issue. It has to be a fair value. And that fair value may not be sufficient to create enough pain to nudge the change to refrain from plastic bags.\u201d The practice of charging for plastic bags has been around for a few years now, with 7-Eleven, Watsons, Guardian, FairPrice Xpress and 11 FairPrice supermarkets among those doing so. In 2019, when seven FairPrice supermarkets and convenience stores started a plastic bag charge trial, seven in 10 customers at the supermarket outlets used reusable bags or refused plastic bags. A FairPrice spokesman said recently: \u201cThere were initial challenges, such as having to manage customers who did not want to pay the charges. We expect greater customer buy-in over time.\u201d Eleven FairPrice supermarkets, including the outlet at Kallang Wave Mall, now charge 20 cents per transaction if a customer opts for plastic bags. But this has led to some customers asking for more plastic bags since they are paying the extra 20 cents, noted Ms Tan Huileng, executive director of environmental group Zero Waste SG. With smaller shops, the bag charge has shown promising results. At Guardian, which has been charging for plastic bags since April 2022, shoppers tend to take a bag only when they buy larger or more items. In late 2021, Watsons introduced a bag charge of 10 cents per transaction for Mondays to Wednesdays. With 80 per cent of customers declining plastic bags, the charge became a daily one from September 2022. Swedish furniture giant Ikea was the pioneer among retail chains in Singapore when it imposed a plastic bag charge in 2007. From 2013, it did away with carrier bags completely, and customers had to use their own bags or buy its signature blue Frakta bag for $1. In the lead-up to the bag charge in July, environment organisations are engaging shoppers and increasing their access to reusable bags. Until end-April, Zero Waste SG will run weekend roadshows at selected supermarkets and place a bag rack there for shoppers to take and donate reusables. Plastic-Lite Singapore has bag-sharing booths, called Bounce Bags, at four locations, including Bukit Merah Central and Heartbeat@Bedok, so residents can help themselves to donated bags before their shopping trips. Its founder Aarthi Giri said: \u201cSince we generally don\u2019t have the habit of carrying shopping bags from home, such bag-share points can help us ease into the habit of bringing reusables eventually.\u201d Thanks to positive responses from consumers, the FairPrice chain saved 57 million plastic bags in 2022. Dr Ong Suan Ee, senior health systems researcher at think-tank Research For Impact, said: \u201cThis bodes well for the introduction of future policy changes in the same vein for other single-use plastics, such as legislating the charge for straws and food containers.\u201d",2023-04-03T08:15:03,access to healthcare

Like SGS, the Singapore Savings Bonds are safe investments, principal-guaranteed by the government, Mrs Teo said. Holders of the SSB can also get their money back in any given month, with no penalty, and can earn interest that is linked to long-term SGS rates. Also, unlike bonds that pay the same coupons each year, the SSB pays coupons that increase over time. The government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are still working on the details of the SSB programme, and will release more information later. To improve the availability of corporate bonds to Singapore retail investors, MAS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) will also ease the financial and administrative costs for issuers seeking to tap the retail market, Mrs Teo said. Two new frameworks as well as a tax deduction have been proposed, and MAS and SGX are targeting to implement the proposals in the second quarter of 2015. ""We hope that corporate issuers with strong financials will utilise the new frameworks and tax concession to issue retail bonds, which will enhance the investment choices for Singaporean investors,"" Mrs Teo said.",2015-03-26T14:31:58,wealth tax

This comes as Singapore's consumer price index (CPI) for all items between July and December last year rose by 3.1 per cent year on year , which is double the 1.5 per cent increase in the first half of last year. The index is used as a measure of consumer price inflation. For those whose household incomes were in the lowest 20 per cent bracket, the CPI for all items rose by 2.4 per cent year on year during the period, compared to 2.7 per cent for the middle 60 per cent in household income, and 3.7 per cent for the highest 20 per cent in household income. Excluding rentals on owner-occupied accommodation, the CPI for the lowest, middle, and highest income groups rose by 2.3 per cent, 2.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent year on year respectively. The main contributors to the higher inflation rates were cars, accommodation, petrol, food and electricity, but these price increases were partially offset by lower costs of telecommunication services and clothing and footwear. The lowest income group saw the smallest increase in inflation rates as the increase in car and petrol prices had less of an impact on them. Pump prices rose from $2.42 to $2.47 on July 2 last year to $2.55 to $2.57 per litre on Dec 28 for 92-octane petrol, while prices for 95-octane prices increased from $2.44 to $2.54 per litre to $2.58 to $2.61 over the same period. Out of the three income groups, those in the lowest income bracket spend the highest proportion of their income on housing and utilities, as well as on food. In contrast, the highest income group spent a larger proportion of their income on cars and petrol compared to the lowest and middle income groups. Associate Professor Yeo Wee Yong from the National University of Singapore's finance department said the prices of items such as cars, petrol and electricity tend to affect higher income groups more. ""Although food prices increased as well, prices of items such as clothing, footwear and telecommunication services that may also take up a big proportion of the income of lower income groups fell,"" he said. Inflation is set to be a key challenge in 2022, as prices rise across different consumer goods, exacerbated by supply chain disruptions, border restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic and an impending hike in the Singapore goods and services tax from 7 per cent to 9 per cent.

860,642219,Post,['94166694'],https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/all-about-dividends.5064974,,5064974,Forums,All about Dividends,"After many years here, one of the most basic repeated questions has always been about dividends. As such, I will summarise the key points here that any beginner can refer to regarding dividends. I would be using layman terms for the most part so beginners can easily understand. A) Dividends are a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings, decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders. Simply, dividends are what the company pays you for holding their stocks. B) Dividends are not compulsory. It is different from Reits' distribution but the difference isn't gonna mean much to a layman. C) Dividends can be pay out yearly, quarterly, monthly or even randomly without a fixed schedule. Most company that has a culture of paying out dividends though, would adhere to a certain frequency. Commonly found in the US is a quarterly payout. D) Dividends has many dates that will appear to confuse beginners. Just for simplicity's sake, the following are the more important ones to note... 1. Ex-Div, this means excluding dividends . It means if you buy a stock on this day, it excludes the latest dividend payout. Do not buy on this date if you want the dividends. e.g. ex-div is July 27, buy on July 26 or anytime before that to get dividends I repeat, buy before July 27 to get dividends. 2. Pay date or Date Paid/Payable, all means the same. It is the date where you will see the dividends in your bank account. The day you received the $$. Every time a company pays dividends, the ex-div date decide who would get the dividends while the pay date decides when you receive it. 3. CD or Cum-Dividend, it's not important. It basically means including dividends but it might confuse you as a beginner. Go wiki if you really need to know. Just don't bother if it's confusing you. 4. Record date, means nothing to you as a beginner. Don't bother. Go wiki if you really need to know. Just don't bother if it's confusing you. E) Selling, if your sole purpose is to get dividends and you wish to sell the minute you are confirmed that you are entitled to a dividend, sell on ex-div date. How this works is, e.g. ex-div date is August 15, you want to get the dividends, you buy on August 14, hold it to August 15, sell it on August 15, ta-da, you have the dividends. Yes, holding it for a day is all it took. Note that, it's a zero-sum game usually to try this method as the Stock would gap down(meaning move down) to show the pay out of the dividends. E.g. if ex-div is on February 12, the stock price is $10 on Feb 11, the dividends is $1, The stock would most likely open at around $9 on Feb 12, thus taking into account the $1 dividend that is paid out. So if you buy on feb 11 the stock would be $10. On feb 12, the stock would be $9, and you will be entitled to a $1 dividend. The above is the usual case but there are exceptions where the stock swings back up immediately to the price pre-exdiv or $10 in this case. But the fall is nearly always gonna happen. F) Also, dividends stocks in SG are not taxable. You will receive whatever amount is declared to be the dividends paid out. The tax is already done at the corporate stage, don't need to worry about it. G) Another thing is dividends cash/shares options. A company can choose to pay you either with dividends shares or cash($), both the shares and the cash should come to about the same value though sometimes there might be a discount given for taking shares. OCBC recently gives out discounted shares, i.e. their stock price per share is for example $10.30, they give you shares for $9.70. That means if you are suppose to receive $19.40 in dividends, you will get to receive 2 shares of OCBC if you pick to take shares instead of dividends cash. You cannot choose both. Also, if your dividend cash has any left over, e.g. if you recevied $20 dividends and you choose shares, you will get 2 shares and $0.60 cash back into your bank account. I'm not sure about this but will update when someone can clarify. edit: ok, scb will round down any odd shares so it's best to choose cash. As for shares round up/down, it still depends on the individual counters, always check before subscribing to shares or you might lose the leftover cash. H) to find the dividend dates, refer to sgx.com, move your cursor to Company Information(the 2nd blue bar at the top), choose Corporate Action from the drop down list, and you will see all the dates for the dividends. If you need to find a particular company's dividends, use the 'Company Name:' to find it. I) Special dividends, these are dividends that are on top of the usual payout you see from the company, it is usually a 1 time thing and should be treated as a bonus. J) Rights and other offers, this you will need to wiki. Hope the above clears up most doubts people have with regards to dividends. Feel free to correct any mistakes you see and I will update this post.",2015-05-29T22:31:53,wealth tax

Note that I put CAN cuz I know a lot of edmwers will comment n say that sinkie women only know how to take n demand, but there will still be some good ones. Im also aware that being in a toxic relationship is worse if not, the next best thing is singles must learn to love themselves n pamper themselves once in awhile. Otherwise will definitely feel burn out n feel that life is meaningless after awhile. Cuz everyday work work work, after work n weekends take care of elderly parents.

These claims made by Jesselton Dental Centre at Pacific Plaza exceeded the allowed limit for Chas subsidies and were not accompanied with proper supporting documentation, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Jan 13). ""Audits on Jesselton Dental Centre conducted in late-2018 to 2019 revealed severe non-compliances,"" said the MOH. The termination was issued on Dec 10 and will take effect from this Saturday (Jan 16). The MOH advised affected patients to visit other nearby Chas-accredited dental clinics instead. In response to queries from The Straits Times, a Jesselton Dental Centre spokesman said on Wednesday (Jan 13) that the claims were submitted by an administrative staff and a member of the clinic\u2019s management team between 2017 and 2018. Both of them were let go immediately after they were found to have made the claims. \u201cWe are working alongside the authorities to remedy the situation. Our patients always come first,\u201d the spokesman said. MOH said it was informed last April by the clinic in Scotts Road that its ownership and licensee had changed hands from Resilient Healthcare Group to Alliance Management Group. ""This cessation of Resilient Healthcare Group Pte Ltd as the licensee, coupled with the extent of Jesselton Dental Centre's non-compliance, made the termination of the clinic from Chas necessary,"" it said. ""MOH will continue to investigate the clinic even with the change in ownership."" Provided that its dentists hold valid registration and practising certificates from the Singapore Dental Council, the clinic can still treat patients, but the treatment it provides will not be covered by Chas subsidies. The Health Ministry added that Alliance Management Group has applied for Chas accreditation for the clinic. ""MOH encourages patients to actively engage their doctors and dentists if they have any queries on their bills,"" said the ministry. ""We also remind healthcare professionals to uphold a high standard of professionalism and adhere to their ethical code and ethical guidelines.""

This comes as Singapore's consumer price index (CPI) for all items between July and December last year rose by 3.1 per cent year on year , which is double the 1.5 per cent increase in the first half of last year. The index is used as a measure of consumer price inflation. For those whose household incomes were in the lowest 20 per cent bracket, the CPI for all items rose by 2.4 per cent year on year during the period, compared to 2.7 per cent for the middle 60 per cent in household income, and 3.7 per cent for the highest 20 per cent in household income. Excluding rentals on owner-occupied accommodation, the CPI for the lowest, middle, and highest income groups rose by 2.3 per cent, 2.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent year on year respectively. The main contributors to the higher inflation rates were cars, accommodation, petrol, food and electricity, but these price increases were partially offset by lower costs of telecommunication services and clothing and footwear. The lowest income group saw the smallest increase in inflation rates as the increase in car and petrol prices had less of an impact on them. Pump prices rose from $2.42 to $2.47 on July 2 last year to $2.55 to $2.57 per litre on Dec 28 for 92-octane petrol, while prices for 95-octane prices increased from $2.44 to $2.54 per litre to $2.58 to $2.61 over the same period. Out of the three income groups, those in the lowest income bracket spend the highest proportion of their income on housing and utilities, as well as on food. In contrast, the highest income group spent a larger proportion of their income on cars and petrol compared to the lowest and middle income groups. Associate Professor Yeo Wee Yong from the National University of Singapore's finance department said the prices of items such as cars, petrol and electricity tend to affect higher income groups more. ""Although food prices increased as well, prices of items such as clothing, footwear and telecommunication services that may also take up a big proportion of the income of lower income groups fell,"" he said. Inflation is set to be a key challenge in 2022, as prices rise across different consumer goods, exacerbated by supply chain disruptions, border restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic and an impending hike in the Singapore goods and services tax from 7 per cent to 9 per cent.

Commentary: Full subject-based banding will only work if we stop categorising students Parents may worry if their children will be distracted by disruptive classmates when full subject-based banding and mixed form classes take effect. But this reaction is stereotyping at work, says June Yong. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: The full subject-based banding (SBB) system that will kick in nationwide for secondary school students in 2024 promises to usher in a new era of a strength-based approach to learning. Along with it, the old labels of Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) will no longer be used to build walls around groups of students. But the question is, will these walls remain in our minds? HOW FULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING WORKS\u200b Students entering secondary schools next year will no longer be sorted into Express and Normal streams. Instead, each student will take most subjects at either the G3, G2 or G1 level, which is mapped from today\u2019s Express, N(A) and N(T) standards, depending on their performance in the subject. Form classes are expected to have roughly equal proportions of G3 students and G1 or G2 students, depending on the school\u2019s makeup. They will take certain subjects together with their form class, such as PE, Art and character and citizenship education. But when it comes to mathematics, science and languages, the students will be split according to the subject level they are taking. I admit that my own first reaction to SBB was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be mayhem to lump the different students together in one class? How would the teachers teach?\u201d I had to call myself out for automatically assuming that the students who would take most of their subjects at the G1 or G2 levels would be the naughtier ones. Mr Tan, a teacher whose school has been piloting SBB for the past three years, shared that very often when teachers walk into a new class, they cannot tell the difference between the students in the Express stream and those in the Normal streams. Over time, certain differences may emerge - for example, Express-stream students may be more concerned about their academic performance, while their N(A) and N(T) counterparts may be less interested in their studies or may not follow instructions as readily, he described. But he added a caveat that this could also be stereotyping at work, admitting that both groups of students are more similar than we think. For example, he once met a student who was very well behaved and polite, and later found out that this student was from the N(T) stream. Such experiences have helped him realise that these categories really do not matter. THE BEAUTY OF SUBJECT-BASED BANDING\u200b When it comes to understanding the whys behind this new system, no one can fault its aim to remove the stigma of unhelpful labels that have resulted in a division between \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d at such a formative age. SBB treats every student as an individual, and seeks to maximise each person\u2019s potential. At the same time, I have heard many parents voice their worry about whether their children will end up being inadvertently taxed in this new system. One common concern is that they may end up being distracted by their naughtier classmates. But is this phenomenon of having disruptive classmates new? Would it be caused solely by the SBB system itself? That we seem to fall back on the trope that lower-ability students behave poorly may be reflective of how sticky the old labels are and how much persistence is required to scrub them off. To prod us along, we may need to revisit the benefits of heterogeneous classrooms. Diversity in a mixed classroom allows students to learn from one another\u2019s differences. In such a setting, there is also the potential for role modelling to take place, as weaker students learn from positive behaviours in class. According to Mr Tan\u2019s observations of his mixed form classes, the children actually get along with one other. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long for the students themselves to realise that different people have different gifts. Whereas in the old system, they\u2019re always made to believe that the one is better, and the other, worse.\u201d \u201cIf they can co-exist in this space, it will help them later on when they enter the workplace. They can hang out with anyone,\u201d he said. RISING TO THE CHALLENGE OF MIXED FORM CLASSES\u200b But friendships aside, it will remain to be seen as to whether the classroom setting will truly be more egalitarian and stigma-free. And this is where the skill level of educators comes in. In one research study, Stanford University researchers Elizabeth Cohen and Rachel Lotan hypothesised that teachers could affect students\u2019 perceptions of status in a heterogeneous classroom by altering the expectations of competence that students hold for themselves and for one another. They proposed two interventions: The multiple ability intervention and assigning competence to low-status students. The former entails discussing the many different intellectual abilities required by collective tasks, such as reasoning or problem-solving. The latter involves the teacher, after having observed instances of low-status students performing well on abilities relevant to the task, providing the student with specific, positive and public evaluations. The researchers found that the interventions were effective in promoting equal-status behaviour in the classroom, and clocked significant gains in participation and achievement of low-status students. This study shows that the role of the educator is particularly important in ensuring that classrooms are safe and effective learning spaces for all. While there may no longer be different streams, teachers are the first ones who have to fully embrace SBB and take intentional steps to ensure that lower-ability learners in their form classes are valued for their strengths. And because it might be more difficult to engage everyone equally, it may also mean that form teachers will need to give themselves time to understand their students better and to adjust their teaching methods accordingly. HELPING EVERY STUDENT FIND THEIR PLACE\u200b In the new system, everyone has a part to play. \u201cBeing a form teacher of a mixed class has made me realise that many of the kids are talented in different areas,\u201d explained Mr Tan. \u201cSome of the lower-ability students have very strong leadership traits. Some of them are showmen who are not afraid of going on stage and expressing themselves. They end up being the cheerleaders in class.\u201d While it is easy to reach for labels to help explain the different behaviours we may come across in class, it may be even better to focus on each student as an individual with different strengths, weaknesses and needs. \u201cIt has also made me realise that categorising them is really my problem. We need to shift gears and help them find the thing they\u2019re good at,\u201d he added. June Yong is the Lead of Insights at Focus on the Family Singapore.",2023-03-08T08:18:46,education subsidies

When you can start applying: Typically in the evening on the day it is announced. So check in the evening. How to apply: If you refer to the link only can only apply through the 3 local banks. would suggesting using browser webpage to apply cause their apps may not supported. DBS: Invest > Singapore Government Securities (SGS) > T-Bill > Deadline to apply: Based on what's known at the time of writing, application typically closes 1 day before auction @ 9pm for OCBC and DBS and based on what's reported by some, 12 noon for UOB (in dispute). But do yourself a favour by checking instead of relying on whats written on a public forum where you cannot hold anybody accountable for. it is for you to lose. Outcome and refund: you will know the outcome of the auction on the day of the auction after it happens (auction takes place around 1 pm, so you should know not too long after that so just be patient to wait). if you are successful, the ""interest"" (or discount) will be refunded to you the same day by around 5pm. if you are unsuccessful, the amount should also be refunded to you by 5pm same day. It has been reported that if you are successful OCBC will send you a text and email to inform you DBS will only send you a letter after the t-bill has been issued (see the issuance calendar for that) UOB will send you a text but in any case this is not really important as a refund of the interest already mean you are successful. Credit: you can see the t-bill in CDP around 5pm (might take longer if overwhelming subscription) on the issue date. it isn't like SSB where there is an additional seperate portal you can log in to see. in any case seeing it in CDP is the most important since that's where it is held in CDP you should be seeing 10 units if you applied for 1,000, as the face value is 100 per t-bill End of Tenor: the face value will be credited to your bank account linked to CDP Multiple applications: users have reported that you can submit multiple applications, e.g., non comp, comp @ 2.5%, comp @ 3%. CPF Application: Has to be done in branch of the 3 local banks. @Happyhappydays has kindly shared that for T-Bill application with CPFIS, only the amount AFTER discount is deducted. So e.g., apply 10k in the most recently concluded auction, where cut-off price is 98.577. only $9,857.70 gets deducted. Unlike cash, where 10k gets deducted, followed by a credit of 142.30. Deduction took place on 8 Aug (issue date being 10th). Can't be certain about the process, but based on this 1 example, it takes place 1 working day prior to issue date. for it to be worth using OA of rate 2.5%, the t-bill yield has to be 2.9%++ as calculated by some Additional useful reference: https://investmentmoats.com/saving-...y-singapore-treasury-bills-t-bills-sgs-bonds/",2022-06-24T08:06:52,medical expenses

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - The traditional norm of men marrying a wife who is less educated than them and women looking for a better-educated husband is changing. The proportion of men with wives who have less education than them fell from 16.3 per cent of marriages in 2011 to 12.3 per cent last year. Meanwhile, the share of marriages involving a woman who is better educated than her husband increased from 17.5 per cent of all marriages in 2011 to 18.2 per cent last year. The data was contained in the Statistics on Marriages and Divorces 2021 and published by the Department of Statistics (DOS). It was released on Wednesday (July 6). However, the majority of marriages involve couples with similar educational levels. Some 69.5 per cent of couples who wed last year fell into this category, up from 66.2 per cent in 2011. The increase in such couples is due to the higher share of civil marriages where both partners are university graduates and Muslim marriages where both husband and wife have post-secondary or university qualifications, the DOS said. The National University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser described the trend of fewer men marrying less-educated wives and vice-versa for the women as socially significant. But he noted that educational qualifications may not necessarily be a good indicator of income and that income is still a key concern while selecting partners. Ms Shailey Hingorani, head of research and advocacy at the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), noted that traditional gender roles dictate that higher education increases one's job prospects, making the man more attractive as a husband who can fulfil the breadwinner role, while it decreases the chances of a woman staying home and depending on her husband to provide for the family. But there are now more female tertiary graduates, compared to men, and this has led to more men marrying someone with similar educational levels and fewer men with a less educated wife, said Dr Tan Poh Lin, an assistant professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at NUS. Fei Yue Community Services social worker Marie Yeo said as more women are highly educated these days, they are financially independent and may not have qualms about marrying a less educated man. She has also seen a shift in expectations of the roles and responsibilities between the couple, adding: ""Women today value and expect men's equal contribution at home, and we are glad to see more men willing to take up their share of domestic responsibilities such as household chores, marketing and caregiving, while women also work and contribute financially to the home.""",2022-07-06T21:05:34,less educated

Comparisons are based on Age 1 till Age 75 for private integrated shield plan (ISP) Price Revision for Main Plan No change in premiums for Aviva, Prudential and Raffles. AXA, AIA and GE revised the premiums upwards. NTUC revised premiums downwards. Price Revision for Riders No change in premiums for NTUC, Prudential, Raffles, Aviva (A-II). AXA, AIA and GE revised premiums upwards. Aviva (C-II) revised premiums downwards. Medishield Main Plan Benefit Overview There are some enhancements in the benefits as summarised in the table below. Do take note that some insurers require 'pre-authorisation' before panel benefits get 'unlocked' Update: AIA has removed the dreaded 85% Pro-ration option. Rider Benefit Overview As mentioned by fellow forumers, those holding Prudential 100% riders prior to 2018 get to keep the 'zero out of pocket' benefit subject to claim base pricing. All other insurers will have their customers on 100% riders migrated to co-pay plan. Price comparison of IPs Raffles + Key Rider is the most affordable, followed by AXA + Enhanced Care Plan A. Among plans with LITE option, prudential plan stands out as it is not subjected to claim based pricing and only 5% Co-payment Bill Size Observations 1) For small bill sizes of < $60,000/- , the difference between panel and non-panel is negligible 2) For NTUC Classic rider, there is very minimal savings of $1,150/- if the insured goes to non-panel. It is highly recommended that the insured chooses panel if he/she intends to get the Classic rider. 3) Currently, only GE and Prudential* has adopted claimed based pricings. AIA has a claim based option that is only applicable to those insured under their old 100% rider. *PruExtra Premier Lite does not have claim based pricings Correct as of 12/04/2021 You can download the excel with all the calculations at this link: CLICK HERE FOR LINK TO GOOGLE DRIVE Disclaimer: I am not a financial consultant and am in no way related to the insurers.

To make it more convenient for aid seekers, those applying for ComCare's Short-To-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) scheme can also do so online at the SupportGoWhere portal in the coming months. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) announced these on Thursday (March 10) as part of its ongoing efforts to enable low-income families to get help more easily and in a shorter time. By the second quarter of this year, eligible families whose ComCare schemes are approved qualify automatically - without the need to apply - for the Ministry of Education's (MOE) Financial Assistence Scheme, which offers school fee waivers and transport subsidies, among other things, and the MSF's Student Care Fee Assistance scheme. The MSF also plans to let eligible ComCare families automatically enjoy the maximum fee subsidy for one year for children attending MSF-registered student-care centres or special student-care centres for those with disabilities. Up to 10,000 students are expected to benefit from these changes. ComCare is the Government's key social safety net. It provides short- to medium-term financial aid for low-income individuals and families in need, as well as long-term financial aid for the destitute who are permanently unable to work and have little or no family support. The MSF is also planning to progressively expand the number of schemes where ComCare applicants do not need to apply for separately, such as pre-school subsidies and housing and healthcare schemes, so that they can automatically get help from these other schemes if they get ComCare aid. For example, by the end of the year, eligible ComCare recipients will automatically get medical and dental subsidies at certain clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme. About 30,000 ComCare families are expected to enjoy greater convenience and a shorter wait before they get help from these schemes, in what the MSF describes as its bundling of help schemes. Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee said in the debate on the MSF's budget on Thursday (March 10) that there has been a ""deep shift"" in how the ministry delivers social services in the past few years. The focus is now on ""putting the family at the centre"" and meeting families' needs in a proactive and coordinated manner across different government and community agencies, instead of organising social services around programmes or agencies. He said: ""We call this our 3C approach... comprehensive in addressing presenting issues as well as deeper root causes; convenient support, so that families can focus their energies in improving their lives; and coordinated across different agencies and partners."" While those applying for ComCare's SMTA can do so online at the SupportGoWhere portal by the second quarter of the year, they can continue to do it in person too. Mr Lee said the portal - which consolidates information from different help schemes - will be improved so that users can check if they qualify for certain schemes, apply for aid directly and get updates on their application through a single platform. Over the next few years, the MSF will allow people to apply for more help schemes through the portal. In his speech, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli outlined the different policies the Government has put in place to improve the lives of Singaporeans and, in particular, the low-income groups, such as through ComCare and Workfare Income Supplement, which tops up the wages of lower-income workers. ""We must not allow inequality to become entrenched, as seen in most advanced economies. Going forward, addressing social needs will become even more complex,"" he said. Mr Masagos, Mr Lee and Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua also spoke about Community Link (ComLink), which provides comprehensive and coordinated support tailored to the needs of more than 14,000 families with children living in highly subsidised Housing Board rental flats. Mr Lee described ComLink as the MSF's flagship initiative of its 3C approach. Mr Masagos said the MSF and its partners, instead of waiting to be approached, seek out low-income families proactively to help them address their problems and to improve their lives through ComLink. Mr Chua said ComLink has reached out to more than 6,800 families since the programme started in 2019. Last year, the programme was rolled out in 11 towns and will be introduced nationwide for the remaining 10 towns in the coming months. One of its beneficiaries is housewife Norhamidah Mah Hassan, 29, whose family of seven receives $1,650 a month under ComCare's SMTA. Her husband is unable to work as he is unwell, and the couple have five children aged between three and nine. The family lives in a one-room rental flat. Madam Norhamidah, who is expecting her sixth child, said: ""Without ComCare, it will be very difficult for us and we have to borrow money from others."" Three of her children are on the MOE financial aid scheme and automatic qualification for the scheme for ComCare recipients like her helps save time and money, as she does not have to pay to photocopy the documents needed to apply for aid.",2022-03-10T23:20:14,Community Health Assit Scheme

Medishield-life turns out to be a scam that robs poor people in Singapore? http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/new-riders-for-ip-plans-will-include-co-pay-feature Sadly, I read in the papers that the rich who can afford the highest level medical insurance plans are probably the biggest/ worst exploiters of the compulsory national healthcare insurance scheme in Singapore. As it is reported in 'New riders for IP plans will include co-pay feature' [ST, 08 March 2018]: ""People with full riders have bills that are 60 per cent higher than those without riders."" http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/new-riders-for-ip-plans-will-include-co-pay-feature As I understand, the 60% difference refers to the difference between already rich people: i.e. the rich (own just medishield-life integrated plans) vs the ultra rich (own insurance riders in ADDITION to the integrated plans).  As compared to the poor (only have compulsory basic 'medishield-life'), the difference cannot be more stark since as the example highlighted by Mr Gilbert Goh (appended below or at https://www.facebook.com/goh.gilbert/posts/10157361126798975?pnref=story )  some poor Singaporeans skip medical treatments due to inability to afford transportation costs. Having more comfortable care at government and private hospitals may also mean that richer patients live longer and thus stand to benefit from the concept of 'pre-funding' since poor people finding it hard to physically transport themselves to medical care locations implicitly benefit less from the compulsory national healthcare insurance scheme since they will die earlier for reasons of transport costs difficulties and other obvious benefits ONLY available to private integrated medishield-life insurance coverage such as pre/post hospitalization care, cancer immunotherapy, prosthesis benefits, ability to port care benefits to other parts of the world (evacuation costs, overseas treatments) etc. 'Role of pre-funding' https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/pressRoom/Media_Forums/2013/role-of-pre-funding-.html I thus will not be surprised that based upon the concept of 'pre-funding', the shortened life expectancy of poor people, the ability of the rich to afford higher quality/ comfort care / greater options, medishield-life has inadvertently (?or by design?) become a means by which the poor are now implicitly if not explicitly funding the healthcare/ treatment costs for rich people. My suggestion to this obviously obtuse, inhumane, unjust and untenable system of exploiting the poor is to stop any one subscribing to any integrated shield plan or worse still, insurance plan riders (conferring further medical fees waivers) from receiving any subsidies usually accruable to the basic medishield-life portion of the insurance plan .  To provide subsidies to anyone who can afford to subscribe to integrated shield plans is a travesty of justice akin to funding private taxi fares (which is an obvious luxury as compared to public transport (bus/ MTR fares)), to fund people subscribing to any integrated medishield-life plan with an additional rider would be like providing subsidies for people who want to own their own automobiles (just because they under declare their income tax or report a small dwelling place as their residential address): an obvious squander of government funds and worse: complicity in the robbery/ exploitation of the poor since as earlier described, any person who gets a deliberate/ unfair 60% (upwards) upperhand in the nett 'access' to common pool medishield-life funds obtained under the communist/ socialist concept of compulsory 'pre-funding' reveals the gross injustice implicit in the design of medishield-life that blindly subsidises holders of private healthcare insurance plans; which obviously will erode national cohesion and trust in government in the long run. Instead of disbursing medishield-life subsidies liberally (indiscriminately) like one distracts children with cheap candies, a more targeted carrot-stick based upon health consciousness can keep overall cohort medicals claims costs low: e.g. maintaining a low % body fat (below 15% for males and below 25% for females), performing well in fitness tests (modeled after universally used military fitness test like IPPT, with swimming/ cycling alternatives), non-smoking status are all very good (anti-diabetes) options to consider for substantive 'earned' waivers from the costs of premiums for compulsory medishield-life which can be implemented on a national level, as well as the total banning of the use of riders, would make the basic medishield-life scheme a more trusted medical insurance scheme whereby the concept of healthcare insurance returns to the original philosophy of insuring calamities which are unpreventable by doing everything within control to avoid the avoidable (e.g. type 2 diabetes due to sedentary lifestyle, high% body fat causing diabetes etc) . Rather than a sneaky way for the rich to siphon $$$ from the poor to fund their own irresponsible and lavish lifestyles in the ultimate tragedy of the commons and let Singapore go bankrupt due to the lawless, free for all, self-serving buffet syndrom mentality, the result of an extremely poorly planned and executed national healthcare insurance policy. ========================= From: https://www.facebook.com/goh.gilbert/posts/10157361126798975?pnref=story Visited a 50-year-old man who skips his medical appointment twice because he could not gather enough transport money to visit the doctor. He is suspected to have initial stage of cancer of the pancreas and liver. He lost about 30 kg from his previous weight and looks jaundiced. He also owes a few months of utilities, rental and town council charges but feels most worried about the rental debts as HDB has dropped by already to check on him. He is afraid of losing the home though I assured him that so far HDB has not go hard on rental defaultors unlike purchased flat owners. Surprisingly, SSO has rejected his welfare application citing that he still has a son who is now working as an intern earning $1200/month. His Malaysian wife is currently back in Malaysia undergoing dialysis for her diabetic condition. Of course, the SSO wants him to get back to work but his ill health and frail body are not helping him much. He is currently awaiting approval from Comcare side after visiting his MP. I left Jefri after leaving him with a small amount of cash for his meals and assured him that we will assist in one way or another. A regular donor has pledged $500 to offset the $600-over rental default and someone has already paid $100 into the SP bill. At least he will have a roof over his head as he nurses his health slowly back to normal. Apologise that the video is abit soft and last five minutes. Poor People's Campaign: a ground-up community initiative to improve the living condition of the poor among us. ======================= Everyone must compulsorily conform to the concept of 'pre-funding', however, ultimately, it is the poor who paradoxically subsidise the rich since the rich (leveraging upon insurance 'riders') get to claim 60% more (even after proration is considered): Reply from MOH 27 Nov 2013, Straits Times Role of pre-funding WE THANK Mr David Boey (""Problems with pre-funding""; Nov 19), Ms Maria Loh Mun Foong (""Merits of pre-funding""; last Thursday) and Mr Tan Kin Lian (""Pre-funding not feasible for MediShield Life""; Forum Online, Monday) for sharing their views on the concept of pre-funding for MediShield. The letters from Mr Boey and Ms Loh may have created the wrong impression that the proposed pre-funding concept will require the younger generation to cross-subsidise the current elderly. For MediShield, the pre-funded amount contributed by each cohort is set aside for the future use of their own respective cohorts , and not used to cross-subsidise the current elderly. To address concerns over affordability of premiums among the current cohort of elderly Singaporeans, the Government has indicated its plans to provide help for the older generation of Singaporeans. As noted by Mr Tan, health-care costs tend to be higher for the elderly. This, plus the effects of medical advancements and changing expectations, will put further upward pressure on future premiums as we age. For this reason, it will be even more important to set aside some premiums in advance, or pre-funding, to address concerns of premium affordability during old age. With pre-funding, members pay higher premiums during their working ages and, in return, can receive rebates to offset their own future premiums when they grow old. With the ongoing review and enhancement of MediShield to MediShield Life, one of the key issues the MediShield Life Review Committee hopes to engage the public on is increasing the role of pre-funding.

Do scholars get fast-tracked to the top? Has society allocated too much reward for those with exam-passing ability? The series Measuring Meritocracy asks how we can value skills mastery and accord more workers decent pay. www.channelnewsasia.com SINGAPORE: His mother was a cleaner, and Mohamed Hannifa now works to empower people in her industry. As a service engineer at LionsBot International, which makes cleaning robots, the 28-year-old teaches cleaners how to use and maintain the company\u2019s robots. He has also been sent abroad to train technicians and dealers. \u201cHe\u2019s very adaptable,\u201d enthused LionsBot chief executive officer Dylan Ng Terntzer. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to put in the hours \u2014 the hours of travelling on the road, the hours of support over the phone, late into the night. \u201cAnd he\u2019s able to take the stress of facing customers when, sometimes, things don\u2019t go well. So all this helps to mature him and (take his work to) a different level.\u201d Seeing his mother return home with body aches over the years made Hannifa feel he should do something \u201cmeaningful and help her ease her burdens\u201d. Robots can take over tasks such as floor cleaning, which could make up about 60 per cent of the daily work, allowing cleaners to \u201cfocus on the finer points of cleaning\u201d, like high dusting, disinfecting and customer service, said Ng. \u201cThey can do more tasks. Because of that, they can command higher pay. The cleaner is the supervisor of all these robots, deciding the schedule, the workloads,\u201d he added. Hannifa, who has a diploma in mechatronics engineering, never thought he would end up in customer service. After joining LionsBot nearly two years ago, however, \u201cI started loving my job\u201d, he said. \u201cOnce you find your area of interest, stay there, work hard and start growing.\u201d What has also grown in recent years is discussion on what meritocracy means in Singapore\u2019s workplaces. The series Measuring Meritocracy examines the impact of trends such as a growing proportion of workers wielding degrees and asks how society can value skills mastery and accord more workers decent pay. WATCH: Meritocracy at work in Singapore \u2014 how relevant is it today? (45:51) NUMBER OF CLEANERS IS SHRINKING\u200b Cleaners remain among the lowest-paid workers in Singapore, despite governmental support for uplifting their wages and roles. But there is something people may not know about the profession. \u201cThe secret is, there aren\u2019t many cleaners left,\u201d said Ng. There were about 55,000 cleaners in Singapore as at November, of whom 41,200 were citizens and permanent residents, according to the National Environment Agency. A decade ago, the reported number of cleaners here was 70,000. Cleaners are also becoming higher skilled \u2014 in several years, they may become more like facility professionals who have been trained in security and landscaping besides cleaning, Ng reckoned. They would all be assisted by technology and robots, he said. \u201cThe aspirations of the young have risen, and we must meet their aspirations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not just doing a cleaner\u2019s job, but they\u2019re more of a robot operator. In this way, they might feel more empowered,\u201d said Hannifa. They could become more tech-savvy in other areas of their lives in the process, he added. \u2018RESENTFUL AND ALIENATED PEOPLE\u2019\u200b Although many jobs such as cleaning do not require a degree and remain essential to society, the salary gap between graduates and non-graduates has grown. The median pay of university graduates is now more than twice that of Institute of Technical Education (ITE) graduates. Between 2016 and 2021, the median starting salary gap between the two groups grew by S$300 , while that between degree and diploma holders grew by S$200. \u201cWe\u2019ve allocated too much reward and prestige to just one form of human aptitude \u2026 the kind of exam-passing ability that some people have,\u201d said David Goodhart, author of the book \u201cHead, Hand, Heart: The Struggle for Dignity and Status in the 21st Century\u201d. \u201cThat has unbalanced our societies in some ways.\u201d The proportion of job vacancies in Singapore open only to applicants with degrees is increasing, which has been observed in many advanced economies, said Sahara Sadik, assistant director of research at the Institute of Adult Learning. Commenting on the trend in Britain, Goodhart said: \u201cThis is completely the wrong direction. We\u2019ve overshot in the production of academic skills, and we\u2019ve undervalued many of the functions that are absolutely vital for a good society.\u201d This creates two groups of \u201cresentful and alienated people\u201d: Those who do not go to university at all and people who do but do not get the \u201celite professional jobs\u201d they had hoped for, he said. Those without degrees feel undervalued in society; this creates a political problem that has been \u201cone of the drivers of populist politics\u201d, he added. Calling England an \u201cextreme instance of a meritocratically bifurcated society\u201d, Yale Law School professor Daniel Markovits cited the \u201cpopulist uprising\u201d seen in Brexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union. \u201cPeople with elaborate elite educations wanted to stay in the EU. People without those educations wanted to leave.\u201d In the United States, the election of former president Donald Trump \u201ctells exactly the same story\u201d, said Markovits, author of the book \u201cThe Meritocracy Trap\u201d. Given these developments, it is important that Singapore remains an \u201copen, inclusive society where social mobility is alive and possible, even for those who start out as very poor in life\u201d, said Institute of Policy Studies deputy director (research) Gillian Koh. MIDDLE-CLASS WAGES WITHOUT \u2018ELABORATE DEGREES\u2019?\u200b Yet, some shortcomings of meritocracy \u2014 where advancement and economic rewards should be the result of talent or effort, instead of family background or connections \u2014 are clear even before one enters the workforce. Parents who have achieved positions of advantage \u201cmobilise their social networks\u201d to help their children secure valuable internships, opportunities that would not be open to students who are the first in their family to graduate from university, said Koh. \u201cSo can we think about how meritocracy needs to be complemented by other methods and programmes so that these kids gather the right work experience (and) useful contacts, so that when they finally graduate, they have as much chance (to get good jobs)?\u201d A solution, said Markovits, is to restructure the labour market so that people do not require \u201celaborate university degrees\u201d to be able to get good jobs. The Europeans are \u201cvery good\u201d at traditional trades and guilds, \u201cso that you can, in Germany, have a very good job as a glazier or an electrician or a plumber\u201d. \u201cAn ordinary person can\u2019t walk \u2026 off the street and already know how to do it,\u201d said Markovits. These are crafts done by people who have had \u201cserious training\u201d but not degrees, \u201cand they\u2019re paid middle-class wages\u201d. In Singapore, such roles could be in nursing, for example, or port operations. While more nurses now have bachelor\u2019s and even postgraduate degrees, Singapore General Hospital advanced practice nurse Tan Hui Li said nurses without a degree \u201ccan still do their job well\u201d. \u201cBesides the education, caring and doing it (well) comes with experience,\u201d she said. Over at port operator PSA, service engineer Syed Muhammad Fayyadh recently earned his work-study diploma in port automation technology. The course introduced him to software and new technologies that can apply to automated guided vehicles \u2014 skills in line with future port operations.",2023-03-04T08:27:52,meritocracy

Comparisons are based on Age 1 till Age 75 for private integrated shield plan (ISP) Price Revision for Main Plan No change in premiums for Aviva, Prudential and Raffles. AXA, AIA and GE revised the premiums upwards. NTUC revised premiums downwards. Price Revision for Riders No change in premiums for NTUC, Prudential, Raffles, Aviva (A-II). AXA, AIA and GE revised premiums upwards. Aviva (C-II) revised premiums downwards. Medishield Main Plan Benefit Overview There are some enhancements in the benefits as summarised in the table below. Do take note that some insurers require 'pre-authorisation' before panel benefits get 'unlocked' Update: AIA has removed the dreaded 85% Pro-ration option. Rider Benefit Overview As mentioned by fellow forumers, those holding Prudential 100% riders prior to 2018 get to keep the 'zero out of pocket' benefit subject to claim base pricing. All other insurers will have their customers on 100% riders migrated to co-pay plan. Price comparison of IPs Raffles + Key Rider is the most affordable, followed by AXA + Enhanced Care Plan A. Among plans with LITE option, prudential plan stands out as it is not subjected to claim based pricing and only 5% Co-payment Bill Size Observations 1) For small bill sizes of < $60,000/- , the difference between panel and non-panel is negligible 2) For NTUC Classic rider, there is very minimal savings of $1,150/- if the insured goes to non-panel. It is highly recommended that the insured chooses panel if he/she intends to get the Classic rider. 3) Currently, only GE and Prudential* has adopted claimed based pricings. AIA has a claim based option that is only applicable to those insured under their old 100% rider. *PruExtra Premier Lite does not have claim based pricings Correct as of 12/04/2021 You can download the excel with all the calculations at this link: CLICK HERE FOR LINK TO GOOGLE DRIVE Disclaimer: I am not a financial consultant and am in no way related to the insurers.

Holders of the SSB can also get their money back in any given month, with no penalty, and can earn interest that is linked to long-term SGS rates. Also, unlike bonds that pay the same coupons each year, the SSB pays coupons that increase over time. The government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are still working on the details of the SSB programme, and will release more information later. To improve the availability of corporate bonds to Singapore retail investors, MAS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) will also ease the financial and administrative costs for issuers seeking to tap the retail market, Mrs Teo said. Two new frameworks as well as a tax deduction have been proposed, and MAS and SGX are targeting to implement the proposals in the second quarter of 2015. ""We hope that corporate issuers with strong financials will utilise the new frameworks and tax concession to issue retail bonds, which will enhance the investment choices for Singaporean investors,"" Mrs Teo said.",2015-03-26T14:31:58,low income

About 55% of respondents in the mid-May survey conducted by pollster Blackbox Research Pte. said the government was handling everyday price rises \u201cbadly.\u201d Almost 20% said it was tackled \u201cvery badly,\u201d while 36% felt it was dealt with \u201cquite badly.\u201d At the same time, 37% said the government was performing \u201cquite well\u201d and 7% said \u201cvery well.\u201d More than nine in 10 Singaporeans said inflation has affected their lives, with 37% indicating a \u201csignificant\u201d impact, according to the poll based on interviews with 758 people aged 20 and above. It has a margin of error of 3%. That sentiment is an indication of the challenges finance minister and prime minister in-waiting Lawrence Wong faces in convincing voters that the ruling People\u2019s Action Party is doing enough to tackle sharp price rises. Many governments and central banks are acting in tandem to shield their citizens from the cost-of-living crisis sweeping the world. \u201cA perfect storm has emerged post-pandemic that will test the Singaporean government over the next 12 months as it not only seeks to bring about a speedy recovery but also bed in new political leadership,\u201d said David Black, the founder and chief executive officer of Blackbox. Singapore\u2019s cost pressures have been persistent this year, prompting the central bank to tighten monetary policy and revise expectations for price-growth that could crimp the broader post-Covid growth recovery. While officials are hopeful that nominal wage growth will outpace inflation this year, economists see prices remaining elevated in the city-state through 2023. Global inflation, exacerbated by supply-side pressures caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has filtered through to consumers worldwide, even as early signs of inflation peaking appear. In an indication of the risks facing the city-state\u2019s economic recovery as it emerges from strict Covid restrictions, respondents said they have cut back on their spending due to inflation, with nearly nine in 10 spending less on clothing, restaurants, and entertainment at cinemas and theaters. Wong has committed to help residents to cope with consumption tax increases set to kick in initially next year in his maiden budget delivered in February. About 57% of low-income respondents -- earning below S$2,500 ($1,800) a month -- said the government was doing badly, while 59% of medium-low income households, earning S$,2500 to S$6,600, felt the same, the survey showed. Other key points from the poll include: Singaporeans are feeling the most inflation pain in petrol prices (35%), followed by utility prices (34%), and at supermarkets (28%) 66% of Singaporeans say they feel negatively about rising public housing prices Only 44% believe that they will be economically better off this year than 2021",2022-06-10T17:03:07,low income group

This new requirement, which also applies to domestic helpers, is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses as medical costs rise, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday, highlighting that more than 5 per cent of foreign workers\u2019 medical bills exceed the current $15,000 coverage limit. An average of more than 1,000 employers a year face this issue, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament in March 2022, when he announced the move for additional insurance coverage. MOM estimates that more than 99 per cent of bills for hospitalisation and surgical procedures will fall within the new coverage limit. Under the new rules, employers also have to co-pay 25 per cent of claim amounts that go above the first $15,000. This means that if a worker incurs a $60,000 bill for heart surgery, for instance, the employer will have to pay $11,250, which is 25 per cent of $45,000. The insurer will cover the other $48,750. From July 2025, several other changes will also be implemented. Employers will no longer need to pay for their workers\u2019 medical treatment upfront and claim the amount from insurers later. Insurers will be required to reimburse hospitals directly. There will also be a standard list of allowable exclusions for insurers, such as procedures that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery. Insurers will not have to cover the treatments for pre-existing illnesses occurring within the first 12 months of work under the same employer. Insurers must also offer different premiums for workers aged 50 and below, and those above the age of 50, from July 2025. There were 1,033,500 work permit holders \u2013 of whom 268,500 were maids \u2013 and 177,900 S Pass holders working in Singapore as at the end of last year. Medical bills of migrant workers are not subsidised or covered under national schemes such as MediShield Life and MediFund. MOM said the policy changes are being implemented in phases to give employers and insurers time to adjust to the cost impact. The ministry added: \u201cWith many insurers expressing interest to offer the enhanced medical insurance products, the market will be competitive and employers will have a range of insurers to choose from.\u201d Employers must provide medical insurance coverage of at least $60,000 for maids, migrant workers from July This is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses, said MOM.

Anyway I must thank the forum pals here for all their postings and especially gasband for his excellent and detailed advice. It certainly helped make my trip a smooth and successful one. Thanks Gasband ! Thought I would also share some pictures of my trip as well. Landed in Christchurch and  immediately was picked up  by Teddy from Anzed rentals. His service is really good. Not only does he pick and send his customers to and from the airport but he also takes time to give good driving advice and route suggestions. He also had loan for free handphones, music CDs, hot water flask and even a rice cooker for those who miss their their. He used to live in Singapore before migrating to NZ and I would recommend him for those thinking of renting a car in South island. Took the car and immediately set off for lake tekapo. Unfortunately it was a rainy day and quite gloomy which did not make the scenery as good as usual. Driving was easy in NZ, the further we get away from Christchurch the fewer the cars and the road conditions are  good. As we reached lake tekapo, we were greeted by very nice flowers called lupines by the road side. lake tekapo reknowned for the fantastic colour of the lake surrounded by mountains and for its brilliant night sky. Unfortunately it was cloudy and very cold when we were there. The temperature outside was easily less than 10 degrees but still the sceneery was great. the famous stone church of Tekapo clouds falling over the moutains !

Like SGS, the Singapore Savings Bonds are safe investments, principal-guaranteed by the government, Mrs Teo said. Holders of the SSB can also get their money back in any given month, with no penalty, and can earn interest that is linked to long-term SGS rates. Also, unlike bonds that pay the same coupons each year, the SSB pays coupons that increase over time. The government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are still working on the details of the SSB programme, and will release more information later. To improve the availability of corporate bonds to Singapore retail investors, MAS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) will also ease the financial and administrative costs for issuers seeking to tap the retail market, Mrs Teo said. Two new frameworks as well as a tax deduction have been proposed, and MAS and SGX are targeting to implement the proposals in the second quarter of 2015.

One of them is Mr Nigel Leong, who at 48 years old is finally pursuing his first passion, nearly three decades after he was dissuaded by his parents from taking a degree in nursing. This year, the former regional quality manager at a multi-national company tendered his resignation and took a significant pay cut to join WSG's Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for Registered Nurses (Degree) in April. He turned down lucrative job offers from other companies, including one that would allow him to relocate to Switzerland, and decided to make the switch to nursing to contribute back to society. Mr Leong, who is single, is expected to graduate from the National University of Singapore's Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies in 2022 as a staff nurse working for SingHealth Community Hospitals (SCH). He is one of 18 participants of the PCP for Registered Nurses who have been sponsored by SCH. Of this group, six nurses have started work at the three community hospitals managed by SCH: Bright Vision Hospital, Sengkang Community Hospital and Outram Community Hospital. Mr Leong said his passion for healthcare started when he was a combat medic while serving his National Service. ""It prompted me to want to pursue a degree in nursing in Sydney, but unfortunately my parents were against it because of the stigma associated with nursing. In the 1990s, it was seen as a lowly job,"" he said. ""My father asked me why should he invest so much money for me to study in Sydney to 'clean people's backside',"" he added with a chuckle. Not wanting to go against his parent's wishes, he took up a degree in food science and has been in this industry for 23 years until he made the career switch. Ms Stephanie Yeap, director of nursing at SCH, said the working experience of mid-career individuals like Mr Leong provides them with a ""different outlook and perspective in their care delivery"", with skill sets that may complement their clinical skills. She added that mid-career nurses also tend to have a stronger passion and drive for nursing. ""These mid-career nurses are at the stage of life where they understand themselves better and know what sort of career would suit them best,"" said Ms Yeap. https://www.straitstimes.com/singap...switch-to-nursing-via-professional-conversion",2020-09-22T21:25:39,professional conversion programme

Let me start with my own personal opinion about how the Singapore education system can be improved: To change to skills based, from the current talking based, * Scrap away humanities subjects: social studies, geography, history, literature. Keep only english to recognize that the situational writing and english language paper 2 are enough to train and test and prepare students for the world, in terms of talking. * Add in religion studies, to take the place of humanities, and also to replace the Civics and Moral Education. This will ensure that the students are equipped with moral values, upon completing the 10 years of compulsory education at 16 years old. Religious studies should be compulsory, and be one of the O level examination subjects. * Secondary time, the secondary school should use AI to help every student identify what are their strengths, based on their academic performance in secondary one and secondary two. It can be a simple listing down of all the final results of the subjects that they have tested in secondary one and secondary two, and ranking them from the best to the worst. Then, offer a suitable subject combination. Currently, the freedom to choose, a bit too headless chicken already. Children only 14 years old, they know how to make wise decision meh? Should actually use AI, as mentioned above, to help them make the right decision. Okay, the secondary 2 streaming quite important, as it will influence the later part: tertiary and university. * Tertiary: this is when a lot of people will waste their time. However, it can be mitigated, if the right decision is made at secondary 2 streaming. * Tertiary and University: learn from Hong Kong, merge the local polytechnics and universities into Polytechnic Universities. This recommendation, to have Polytechnic Universities, will help to lower the age of Singaporeans entering the society to work full-time in their professional career. Currently, Singaporean Males only enter the society to work full-time at the age of 25 to 27. Girls probably around 23 years old. Entering earlier can improve our Singaporeans' competitiveness. If merge Poly and Uni together, * It will be 100% in that profession; no language module or whatever physical education module. * Can potentially reduce the learning to just 3 to 4 years, thereby increasing the Returns on Investment, and reducing the time and other resources required. * After 1 year into 100% learning that profession, those students who cannot make it one, should be forced to change profession; boys should be forced to enlist national service first, when they are more mature in their learning then return to school to learn another profession that is more suitable for them. That said, ITE and JC should be scrapped. Everyone all go through the Polytechnic University route. Good idea hor? Not only would it make it a level playing field for every Singaporean, It will save a considerable amount of time and other resources, and Singaporeans would be able to enter the society to work full-time at a younger age and at a more competitive level, Thereby having more ability to excel in the Singapore economy, and the global economy. The above are my opinions. Can't believe from a small seed can evolve into one big tree that encompasses the Singapore education system from secondary to the time when Singaporeans actually enter the society to work full-time in their professional career. In the following weeks, due to the Mercury and Jupiter Conjunction, this is when there will be people talking about their aspirations for the future, at the same time there will also be people who will be expressing their pessimism about matters. Therefore, now may be a good time to really talk about how we can really improve the Singapore education system, rather than just have a casual conversation about it every Sunday. Let's have a fruitful discussion about how we can improve the Singapore education system.",2023-02-26T15:38:06,social mobility

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - Consumers in Singapore will pay less for electricity bills as the tariff for the second quarter of 2023 drops by an average of 5.4 per cent as compared to the previous quarter. For households, the electricity tariff before goods and services tax (GST) will fall from 28.95 cents to 27.43 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) from Saturday to June 30, said grid operator SP Group on Friday. Taking into account the GST rate of 8 per cent since Jan 1, the new tariff will be 29.62 cents, down from 31.27 cents in the previous quarter. This means the average monthly electricity bill for families living in HDB four-room flats will fall by $4.69 before GST. Currently, the electricity bill for a four-room HDB is $89.32, before GST, for an average monthly consumption of 308.52 kWh. It will be $84.63 for the same usage from April. This is the third consecutive quarter that the electricity tariff has fallen. The tariff had been rising since April 2021 amid a global energy crisis, but dipped slightly by 0.43 per cent per kWh in the last quarter of 2022. The decrease in tariff is due to lower energy costs, SP said, adding that its energy costs have decreased by 1.86 cents per kWh, even as its other costs have increased. These costs, which are paid to power generation companies, are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and power generation. Energy cost accounts for 75.4 per cent of the tariff, while the remainder comprises the expense of transporting electricity through the power grid, and operations. Meanwhile, City Energy, producer and retailer of piped gas, also announced on Friday that the gas tariff for households before GST will dip by 0.16 cent per kWh, from 21.84 cents per kWh to 21.68 cents per kWh for the period from Saturday to June 30. The revised tariff after GST is 23.41 cents per kWh. It attributed the fall in gas tariff to lower fuel costs as compared to the previous quarter.",2023-03-31T13:24:02,lower class

This comes despite an increase in jobs cut in the second half of 2022 , driven by the technology sector, which shed workers to cut costs amid a volatile global environment and after over-expanding during Covid-19, and electronics manufacturing, among others. Despite this, the percentage of retrenched residents, comprising Singaporeans and permanent residents, who found employment increased to 73.1 per cent in Q4, the highest since Q2 2015. The report also found that Singapore saw total employment rise to 227,800 in 2022. This is the highest level of growth seen since comparable annual data was recorded in 1991, surpassing the previous record-high in 2007 when total employment grew by 223,500. Total employment is now 2.9 per cent above the pre-pandemic 2019 level, said MOM. The ministry\u2019s report also showed that resident employment continued to grow, increasing by 26,300 in 2022. The increase is higher than that seen in 2019, and was mostly in sectors such as financial services, as well as information and communications. Non-resident employment contributed to the bulk of the increase in total employment at 201,600, although it has yet to reach its 2019 level. MOM said the increase was \u201cprimarily due to the hiring of work permit holders in sectors such as construction and manufacturing, as employers filled positions following the significant relaxation of border controls in April 2022.\u201d The unemployment rate in 2022 improved from 2021, with the rate for residents declining to 2.9 per cent from 3.5 per cent. The corresponding figure for Singaporeans also dropped - from 3.7 per cent to 3 per cent. As a whole, unemployment fell to 2.1 per cent of the total workforce, compared with 2.7 per cent in 2021. With this, the unemployment rate across all three categories has fallen below the average in 2018 and 2019, said the ministry. Also below the pre-pandemic average in the same period was the long-term unemployment rate of residents, at 0.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the number of job vacancies continued to decline for the third consecutive quarter in Q4 2022, but remained elevated at 104,500. \u201cA significant proportion of vacancies were in sectors such as construction and manufacturing, which were sectors typically more reliant on foreign workers,\u201d said MOM. Domestically, aviation and tourism-related sectors, such as air transport and accommodation, are expected to continue to benefit from the recovery in air travel and inbound tourism, backed by the relaxation of China\u2019s border restrictions, MOM said. \u201cOn the other hand, the growth outlook for outward-oriented sectors like manufacturing remains weak given the broader slowdown in the global economy. \u201cGlobal economic headwinds and slower growth may weigh on labour demand going forward, although hiring sentiments in December 2022 remain positive. Employment growth is likely to ease from 2022\u2019s increase and be uneven across sectors.\u201d Retrenchments in S\u2019pore doubled in Q4 of last year, but total employment returned to pre-pandemic level Most of the cuts were driven by business restructuring.

However, I highly doubt that our pay would double, or triple... Let me start from the Software Development Life Cycle, traditionally, Softwares are developed using the Waterfall SDLC where there is a dedicated amount of time allocated for each phase in the SDLC, and finally at the end, users come to test it before deployment. The major problem with this SDLC is that even if the end product is not what users expected, it is often too late to make changes... Therefore, in recent years, most companies have moved towards using the Agile SDLC, meaning that instead of having a linear SDLC, a subset of the product is delivered every few weeks for users to QC. This is great for overall results, but gone are peaceful days where users can spend their own sweet time to write detailed requirements, and gone are days where developers can just code in silence. You usually end up meeting users almost daily to Ji Ji Wai Wai about your work. Not to mention that there is a Daily Stand Up Meeting to update your progress to the team. On paper, it is find out if anybody is facing any problems, but the way I see it... it is just to ensure that people do not Zhobolan... Also, in the past, IT Jobs are usually segregated, you have your Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Database Administrator, Infrastrature, .etc. Nowadays, got Cloud Technology, this means that Codes, Database, Server, all deploy online to a Cloud Service.

Read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com SINGAPORE - The taxman has launched an audit of property investors who have used a loophole \u201c99-to-1\u201d sales contract to dodge paying the additional buyer\u2019s stamp duty (ABSD). The Straits Times has learnt that letters are being sent to some first-time buyers of private real estate to demand that they explain why they signed fresh agreements to sell just 1 per cent of the same properties to their relatives barely a week after exercising the purchase options. Such backdoor deals allow those relatives who own other properties to become co-owners and co-applicants for bank loans without being involved in the main purchases, which would have attracted the ABSD. The audit by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) will ruffle the property investment community because such cases are apparently quite common. A veteran financial planner told ST that he came across about five cases recently. A property agent added that he was not surprised by the audit because he knew that quite a number of buyers at property launches were advised to exploit \u201cthis loophole\u201d to bring in co-owners later, as they were not required to have bank loans ready when confirming their purchases with the developers. Iras letters seen by ST showed that the audit was for transactions that took place in 2021, but the investigation is likely to target all cases involving such agreements, as there is no time bar for such probes. An Iras spokesman declined to provide details of the audit, but said: \u201cIras takes a stern view of any arrangements for the purpose of reducing or avoiding tax. This includes the scenario where buyers purchase properties under a contrived or artificial arrangement in order to reduce or avoid the ABSD they have to pay.\u201d Cases that are being audited have common factors: The first buyers did not own any real estate, so when they bought properties, seemingly for themselves, they did not have to pay ABSD. Shortly after, they signed 99-to-1 agreements to sell just 1 per cent of the same properties to relatives who have other residential units. Such two-stage deals are done because the first buyers do not have sufficient incomes for bank loans, and so they need co-owners to be co-applicants. If they buy the unit together from the start, ABSD is payable so long as one of the parties is a home owner. By getting a second co-owner to buy the 1 per cent share later, they think they need to pay ABSD only for that minute portion, thus saving 99 per cent of the duty. The audit letter asks the first buyers to provide copies of both the first and second sales agreements. They are also asked why they sold a partial share \u201cin such a short period of time\u201d and why the sale to the second buyer comprised only 1 per cent of the property. The Iras spokesman said: \u201cIn cases of tax avoidance, the Commissioner of Stamp Duties will disregard or vary any tax avoidance arrangement, claw back the rightful amount of stamp duty and impose a 50 per cent surcharge.\u201d Singaporeans who have second properties pay 17 per cent ABSD; those with more properties pay 25 per cent. So if the property bought under the 99-to-1 loophole cost $1 million, the total tax plus penalty would be $252,450 if the second Singapore buyer already has a property. If they own more than one, they have to cough up $371,250 in total. Those payments would be $504,900 or $742,500 if the property was worth $2 million. Permanent residents and foreigners pay higher ABSDs, so their penalties would be even heftier if they are caught. And there could be even more pain in store, as Iras notes: \u201cFurther penalties of up to four times the outstanding amount may be imposed if the stamp duty and surcharge are not paid by the deadline.\u201d Singapore\u2019s leading tax expert, Associate Professor Stephen Phua of National University of Singapore Law Faculty, said the audit may potentially implicate lawyers who have helped clients to enter into such arrangements. \u201cThey were under a duty to highlight the risks of doing so to clients,\u201d he said. But the law here does not impose separate penalties on promoters of tax avoidance schemes, unlike in New Zealand and Australia, which deter professionals from helping clients escape paying taxes. There are also rules for compulsory disclosure in Britain. \u201cPerhaps Iras could consider putting in place such measures to combat aggressive or abusive schemes, for the protection of revenue and sound public policies from being undermined,\u201d Prof Phua added.",2023-04-01T17:33:30,middle income group

In the city-state\u2019s latest bi-monthly auction, 125 bidders successfully offered as much as S$116,020 just for the right to own an \u201copen category\u201d auto, which can be applied towards any vehicle type but frequently ends up being used for larger cars in the densely-populated island. That means the cost of a 10-year ownership permit \u2014 the car isn\u2019t included \u2014 is equivalent to 92 per cent of the nation\u2019s median annual household income. The latest figures come despite government hikes on additional registration fees for cars valued at over S$40,000, a move expected to generate an additional S$200 million in the coming budget year while impacting the top one-third of newly registered cars by market value. The higher government-imposed fee follows an influx of new wealth from places including Hong Kong, mainland China and India after Singapore became one of the first Asian financial centres to successfully emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. But the latest bidding round shows that the higher tax isn\u2019t having much impact. Despite a widely lauded public transit system, in which a bus or subway ride can cost less than S$1, there will always be people in this city of 5.6 million who still want to own a private vehicle \u2014 or maybe more than one \u2014 and can afford to pay, said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking. The pricey ownership rights are the result of a quota system that controls the number of autos allowed on the nation\u2019s streets, helping limit congestion and pollution, through the twice-a-month bidding process. Bid successfully and your shiny new Mercedes-Benz becomes road-worthy. When the overall quota of permits was reduced by 14 per cent and premiums skyrocketed to a then-record high in November last year, luxury models benefited the most, with Mercedes vehicles surpassing Toyota models as the top auto brand registered. In fact, in recent months one in every four cars registered was either a Mercedes-Benz or BMW. Rising prices have also been driven by a growing appetite for electric and hybrid models, which have accounted for more than half of new purchases so far this year. In Singapore, owning a car such as a Tesla Model 3 Performance could quickly surpass US$200,000, depending on the vehicle\u2019s features and the price paid for the permit. For Singaporeans who just want an ordinary vehicle to get to their office or a weekend movie, the hope is that the supply of 10-year entitlements begins to stabilise, a shift that is expected after an adjustment the government\u2019s Land Transport Authority recently made. But for the time being, costs are still trending up. And if you need a car now, the next auction takes place Apr 5.

While wages have generally increased over time, the rise in housing prices has outpaced wage growth in recent years. According to data from the Department of Statistics Singapore, median monthly income from work has increased steadily over the past decade. From 2010 to 2020, the median monthly income for full-time employed residents rose from SGD 3,427 to SGD 4,534, an increase of about 32%. However, during this same period, the price of housing in Singapore also increased significantly.  According to data from the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the resale price index for HDB flats increased by about 46% from 2010 to 2020. This means that while wages in Singapore have generally increased, they have not kept pace with the rise in housing prices. This has made it increasingly difficult for many Singaporeans to afford a home, especially younger generations who are just starting their careers. The Singapore government has implemented various policies over the years to address this issue, including increasing the supply of public housing and introducing measures to cool down the private housing market. However, the issue of affordable housing remains a concern for many Singaporeans. By the way, the above answer has not taken into account the crazy housing price increase in the past 2 years (2021-2022).

The Straits Times reported Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong making the announcement after touring a mobile vaccination centre in Yishun on Monday (27 June). Distribution of the kits will begin some time next month. Wong, who is the co-chairman of the multi-ministry taskforce for COVID-19, also told reporters that there is no need to tighter safe management measures for now. However, this cannot be ruled out, as cases are expected to continue to rise. The Straits Times reported him as saying that the uptick in the number of infections is driven by the newer BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants. The Ministry of Health had said on 21 June that the two variants accounted for around 30 per cent of all virus cases in the past week, up from 17 per cent the week before. Wong, who was with Health Minister and MTF co-chairman Ong Ye Kung during the tour, told reporters that there is no evidence yet that current infections are more severe. With hospitals still able to cope with the situation, Wong said that Singapore should be able to ""ride through this wave"" without having to tighten existing measures.

But with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, Singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. As the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. By 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. Budget 2023 offers targeted support to Singapore\u2019s growing pool of seniors . The ElderCare fund will be topped up by S$500 million, and another S$1.5 billion will be added to the MediFund. But just think about that for a moment. Singapore expects a Budget deficit of S$2 billion in the financial year (FY) of 2022, and a deficit of S$400 million in FY2023. Those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. That is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. If we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won\u2019t need government subsidies. ENSURING OUR RETIREMENT ADEQUACY\u200b As Singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that Singapore workers can do for themselves now. While the Government has kept the rate of contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from S$6,000 to S$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . But this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. If so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. Perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. This number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. A 2019 Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in Singapore is about S$1,400 a month. But considering that the median income per household member in Singapore is about S$3,200 a month, which adds up to S$38,400 per year, let\u2019s work off a round figure of S$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. You can scale this up or down accordingly, but don\u2019t forget to factor in inflation. At an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our S$50,000 target would be equivalent to S$100,000 in around 24 years\u2019 time. And in 48 years\u2019 time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. That, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. That is the income we would need to generate from our savings. Because we don\u2019t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. Taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the CPF Special Account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of S$100,000 a year in 24 years\u2019 time is S$2.5 million. We should ask ourselves if our accumulated CPF contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. If it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. That generally means investing in shares. There is a limit as to how much our CPF money can be invested in the stock market. So, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of CPF. The best time to do that is while we are young. INDIRECT TAXES PREVAIL OVER DIRECT TAXES\u200b Budget 2023 also highlighted the Government\u2019s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. Stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. So too will taxes on luxury cars . We can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. In the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. In the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. However, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. The upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the Government to redistribute wealth. After all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. It is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. SETTING ASIDE MONEY FOR THE NEXT CRISIS\u200b There was another important message in the Budget. While the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. Though Singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year\u2019s Budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. What\u2019s more, Singapore must continue to consciously build up its reserves to prepare for the next crisis. We need to do the same too. The Government has provided Singaporeans with the means to cope with inflationary pressures through voucher schemes . This should help ease some of the pain when we do our daily shopping. More importantly, it buys us time to set aside some money for a rainy day because wages are rising but income tax rates aren\u2019t. It is a window of opportunity that other developed economies have been unable to provide. But we need to fix our roofs when the sun is shining. It will be too late when thunderstorms hit. In summary, Budget 2023 puts households firmly in the driving seat. The Government is treating people as mature adults in a maturing economy. The country\u2019s finances are strong and should be even stronger over time. We too can make our household finances stronger over time by being prudent with our spending and preparing for future uncertainties. If we want our taxes to remain low, we need to do our part to ensure that it stays that way. David Kuo is Co-founder of The Smart Investor.",2023-02-23T09:09:32,low income group

Treatments for attempted suicide, drug addiction and alcoholism will also be included under the mandatory basic health insurance plan. The Ministry of Health (MOH)  on Monday (Dec 21) said the Government has accepted all the recommendations of the MediShield Life Council, which began reviewing the national insurance programme in 2018. While premiums are set to increase by as much as 35 per cent under the first major review of the scheme since its launch, MOH said it will defer premium repayment until end December next year for those who do not have sufficient MediSave balances. The Government has also said it will provide premium subsidies and support of up to $2.2 billion over the next three years. This includes $1.8 billion for existing premium subsidies and support measures for lower and middle-income households, Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors as well as the financially needy. Medishield Life was launched in November 2015 to give Singaporeans and permanent residents lifelong protection against large medical bills from birth. The ministry said the annual MediSave top-ups for Pioneer Generation seniors, which can be used to pay MediShield Life premiums, will be enhanced. The financially needy can also apply for additional premium support, added MOH. Besides subsidies, the support will also include a one-off Covid-19 subsidy for all Singapore citizens for two years to cushion the impact of premium adjustments during the pandemic. The $360 million subsidy will cover 70 per cent of the net increase in premiums after taking into account existing subsidies in the first year, followed by 30 per cent in the second year. Said the ministry: \u201cThese measures will keep the net premium increases for all Singapore citizens to no more than about 10 per cent in the first year.\u201d Commenting on the changes, Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said on Monday: ""MediShield Life was created to ensure that Singaporeans would be protected against large hospital bills for life. To ensure that the scheme can continue to be relevant and sustainable, the Government has accepted the MediShield Life Council's recommendations to enhance the scheme and adjust the premiums. ""We will provide up to $2.2 billion in premium subsidies and support, including an additional Covid-19 subsidy for all Singapore citizens. ""We will ensure that MediShield Life continues to provide coverage for all Singaporeans, for life, and ensure that the premiums remain affordable,"" he added. https://www.straitstimes.com/singap...-medishield-life-councils-recommendations-moh",2020-12-21T18:46:40,MediShield Life

The Children\u2019s Emergency (CE) departments at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital and National University Hospital have experienced very high attendances over the past two weeks. This week, there were on average more than 650 cases per day across both CEs, up from an average of 450 cases per day in early January. Approximately 80% of the patients, including those with COVID-19 infections, presented with mild symptoms, did not require hospitalisation, and were discharged after their ED visits. Amongst paediatric patients who were admitted, most did not stay long in hospital, and were discharged on average within two to three days. The proportion of severe COVID-19 infections and Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) remains low, at less than 1 out of 1,000 paediatric cases. 3.  We advise the public to seek medical treatment at a hospital\u2019s ED only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable bleeding. This allows those with severe illness in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly. It also helps to preserve our hospital capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care. 4.  We urge members of the public, including children, to visit their General Practitioners (GP) or a 24-hour clinic for non-emergencies. If COVID-19 testing or review for symptoms of acute respiratory infection is needed, they can visit Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) for further assessment.

The latest figure, announced Friday, is lower than Singapore's previous low of 1.1 set in 2020 and lower than Japan's 2021 level. The resident total fertility rate refers to the average number of live births a woman has during her reproductive years. Indranee Rajah, who serves as minister in the Prime Minister's Office, told a parliamentary committee that the falling fertility rate was because of people marrying later and parents caring for older family members at the same time as children as the population grays. The decline also was partly due to the Year of the Tiger ""in the lunar calendar, which is generally associated with lower births among the Chinese,"" the minister said. But critics point to a high cost of living in the city state as a deeper cause. About 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing under the Housing & Development Board (HDB). Prices of these homes continue to rise, which contributes to couples waiting longer to marry and start a family. In this month's budget proposal, the government called for bigger cash payouts at birth, a doubling of parental leave for fathers and increased support for HDB home purchases. A total fertility rate of 2.1 is considered ""replacement level,"" which represents the average number of children a woman would need to have to reproduce herself by bearing a daughter who survives to childbearing age, according to the United Nations. Singapore is not the only Asian economy facing demographic headwinds. South Korea's total fertility rate fell to a new low of 0.78 last year, the lowest out of the 38 members of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Japan, which had a fertility rate of 1.3 in 2021, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government has vowed to increase the budget for child rearing support .",2023-02-26T11:05:13,health insurance

How to apply: If you refer to the link only can only apply through the 3 local banks. would suggesting using browser webpage to apply cause their apps may not supported. DBS: Invest > Singapore Government Securities (SGS) > T-Bill > Deadline to apply: Based on what's known at the time of writing, application typically closes 1 day before auction @ 9pm for OCBC and DBS and based on what's reported by some, 12 noon for UOB (in dispute). But do yourself a favour by checking instead of relying on whats written on a public forum where you cannot hold anybody accountable for. it is for you to lose. Outcome and refund: you will know the outcome of the auction on the day of the auction after it happens (auction takes place around 1 pm, so you should know not too long after that so just be patient to wait). if you are successful, the ""interest"" (or discount) will be refunded to you the same day by around 5pm. if you are unsuccessful, the amount should also be refunded to you by 5pm same day. It has been reported that if you are successful OCBC will send you a text and email to inform you DBS will only send you a letter after the t-bill has been issued (see the issuance calendar for that) UOB will send you a text but in any case this is not really important as a refund of the interest already mean you are successful. Credit: you can see the t-bill in CDP around 5pm (might take longer if overwhelming subscription) on the issue date. it isn't like SSB where there is an additional seperate portal you can log in to see. in any case seeing it in CDP is the most important since that's where it is held in CDP you should be seeing 10 units if you applied for 1,000, as the face value is 100 per t-bill End of Tenor: the face value will be credited to your bank account linked to CDP Multiple applications: users have reported that you can submit multiple applications, e.g., non comp, comp @ 2.5%, comp @ 3%.

So e.g., apply 10k in the most recently concluded auction, where cut-off price is 98.577. only $9,857.70 gets deducted. Unlike cash, where 10k gets deducted, followed by a credit of 142.30. Deduction took place on 8 Aug (issue date being 10th). Can't be certain about the process, but based on this 1 example, it takes place 1 working day prior to issue date. for it to be worth using OA of rate 2.5%, the t-bill yield has to be 2.9%++ as calculated by some Additional useful reference: https://investmentmoats.com/saving-...y-singapore-treasury-bills-t-bills-sgs-bonds/",2022-06-24T08:06:52,central provident fund

JOHOR BAHRU: A total of 167 individuals, mostly foreigners, are suing a major condominium developer here for failing to deliver strata titles to luxury units purchased as promised in their sale and purchase agreements (SPAs). The purchasers comprise individuals from Singapore (76), Malaysia (58), China (30), the US (two) and Indonesia (one). The high-end Princess Cove condominiums, purchased at a cost of between RM900,000 and RM1.5 million each, were developed by the Chinese-owned R&F Development Sdn Bhd. The company is a subsidiary of R&F Properties, a leading developer in China. Filed by solicitors Vin Sa & Ian on Feb 14, the suit claims the developer has failed to apply for subdivision of the building within six months of its completion as required under Section 8 of the Strata Title Act 1985. The owners say the scheme was completed and issued with a Certificate of Completion and Compliance (CCC) in November 2018 and has been fit for occupation since. However, the owners claim the developer has failed to submit a proposed strata plan to the director of survey (JUPEM) within six months of that date as required under the law. \u201cThe owners are seeking that the court direct the developer to submit to the authority all necessary documentation within seven days of its order. \u201cThey also want the court to give a deadline for the individual strata titles to be issued by the Johor land office,\u201d read the suit sighted by FMT. The owners are also asking for damages to be assessed, and costs. In an affidavit of support, the owners said that despite several requests, the developer had either failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the lengthy delay or ignored their queries. \u201cIn the event the company folds up or is wound up before the titles are issued, the owners will face huge difficulties and would likely have to incur expenses to secure the titles,\u201d he said. The owners\u2019 lawyer, NG Vinod, confirmed that the suit has been served on the developer. Case management is scheduled to take place in the Johor Bahru High Court on March 20.

Her treatment cost was fully covered by national insurance scheme MediShield Life and national medical savings scheme MediSave, until December 2022, when she had to top up $268.50 in cash. This came as a shock. She has yet to receive her January bill. But she is afraid she might have to continue to pay cash every month due to the change in the way cancer treatments for subsidised patients have been covered since Sept 1, 2022. The change essentially lowered her claim limits for both MediShield Life and MediSave. The September policy change was meant to slow down spiralling cancer costs as well as to help patients better afford cancer care, including more expensive drugs. Since then, both MediShield Life and MediSave were allowed to cover only approved cancer drug treatments. Treatments not on the Cancer Drug List cannot be covered. The same will apply to Integrated Shield Plan coverage from April 1, 2023. Before the change, subsidised patients could claim up to $3,000 a month for their total cancer treatment costs. They may also use an additional $1,200 a month from MediSave. Since September, cancer treatment claims have been split \u2013 with separate claim limits for drugs and services. Patients can now claim $200 to $9,600 a month for one cancer drug treatment. They may also claim up to $1,200 a year for cancer services, which include consultations, scans, lab investigations, chemotherapy preparation and administration, supportive care drugs and blood transfusions. Up to $600 a year from MediSave may also be used. The Ministry of Health (MOH) had said that with the change, 90 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients would have their cancer bills fully subsidised, subject to the 10 per cent co-payment, which MediSave can pay for. Before the change, 70 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients had their cancer bills fully subsidised. But oncologists from the public sector have told the MOH that the $1,200 MediShield Life cap on cancer services is inadequate. Several oncologists told The Straits Times that almost half of subsidised cancer patients, who used to be fully covered, will face similar problems as Ms W. A check with various public hospitals showed that fees for a repeat consultation for subsidised patients range from $21.60 to $72.50. Lab tests, even with subsidies, often cost more than $100, and for some, will top $200. Often, these need to be done every few weeks. Some patients need medication for side effects of treatment, such as nausea or an elevated blood pressure, but such drugs also now come under cancer services. Some need antibiotics when their immune systems are compromised by the medication, and these too come under cancer services. Other procedures such as blood transfusions for patients with blood cancers also add to their costs. Several oncologists, who asked not to be named, said this is clearly not enough. One public sector oncologist said the coverage \u201cneeds to be multiple times the current cap\u201d. Ms W has no problems with cancer drug cost. It is with the cancer services that she finds her insurance coverage inadequate. By her December bill, she had used up the $1,200 yearly coverage limit for cancer services. Her bills for these services range from $400 to more than $800 each month, depending on the tests and medications she requires. The MOH said on Saturday that the MediShield Life cap on cancer services claims will be raised to $3,600 a year from April. But the cap on MediSave withdrawal for cancer services remains at $600 a year. On hearing this, Ms W said: \u201cI\u2019m glad to know that they are revising the current MediShield and MediSave coverage to better help cancer patients. I do hope that the revised amount can at least cover all the necessary tests and scans that we patients have to undergo on a frequent basis.\u201d But the higher cap \u2013 which works out to $300 from MediShield Life and $50 from MediSave a month \u2013 will still not be enough to cover her bills for cancer services. Ms W added: \u201cWith cancer, my life is already uncertain. Every time I do the test, I worry that my cancer might flare up again. Now, I also face financial problems. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to deal with it.\u201d Because of her illness, she has stopped full-time work and is currently working part-time. But this is enough to put her out of reach of MediFund aid, which is a government safety net for the poor. \u201cAt least if insurance can\u2019t pay for this, I should be allowed to use my MediSave. I may not have many more years to live. Why limit MediSave withdrawal to $600 a year?\u201d she asked. Click to expand...

Instead, Singapore was willing to offer tax benefits and subsidies for the use of water and electricity, benefiting the production of 12 inch wafers for memory chips, the report said. Responding to the media discussions, TSMC said it was still evaluating the setting up of a fab for automotive chips in Europe based on the needs of customers and on the level of support from government.

The net result is that locals can take on the jobs at \u201cslightly higher levels\u201d , Dr Tan said, citing findings from internal studies by his ministry on foreign workforce policies. \u201cThis has therefore informed our approach of remaining open to high quality foreign professionals while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of Work Permit holders through quotas and also levies,\u201d he said. However, there is a limit to how much the government can tighten access to lower-skilled foreign workers, due to the size of Singapore\u2019s population, Dr Tan pointed out. Continuing to do so would have a \u201cworse-off\u201d effect on Singapore\u2019s economic progress and industry development, he added. Noting that the same correlation of tightening foreign worker access and improving local employment does not apply at higher skill levels, Perera asked if this meant that Singapore is not producing enough highly skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating. Disagreeing, Dr Tan said: \u201cWe are already doing significantly more to improve on the prospects in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, in the upskilling, in upgrading.\u201d But accelerating changes have forced economies and industries to evolve rapidly, alongside other significant disruptions, he said. \u201cTo keep pace with those and to keep ahead pre-emptively, in terms of making sure that we\u2019re ahead of the competition, we will not just need to develop our own local talent, we will also need foreign workers to come alongside with us and complement us as we move forward.\u201d Dr Tan noted however that the studies \u201care but just one input to the entire policymaking process\u201d, adding that they have their limitations. \u201cFor example, they are unable to account for less quantifiable effects of having foreigners in our workplace and our workforce, such as the knowledge spillovers to locals and other network effects,\u201d he said. This means the impact of the interventions studied might also change if they are applied beyond a certain scale or at a different time period.

This new requirement, which also applies to domestic helpers, is to help employers cover larger bills and minimise their out-of-pocket expenses as medical costs rise, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday, highlighting that more than 5 per cent of foreign workers\u2019 medical bills exceed the current $15,000 coverage limit. An average of more than 1,000 employers a year face this issue, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament in March 2022, when he announced the move for additional insurance coverage. MOM estimates that more than 99 per cent of bills for hospitalisation and surgical procedures will fall within the new coverage limit. Under the new rules, employers also have to co-pay 25 per cent of claim amounts that go above the first $15,000. This means that if a worker incurs a $60,000 bill for heart surgery, for instance, the employer will have to pay $11,250, which is 25 per cent of $45,000. The insurer will cover the other $48,750. From July 2025, several other changes will also be implemented. Employers will no longer need to pay for their workers\u2019 medical treatment upfront and claim the amount from insurers later. Insurers will be required to reimburse hospitals directly. There will also be a standard list of allowable exclusions for insurers, such as procedures that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery. Insurers will not have to cover the treatments for pre-existing illnesses occurring within the first 12 months of work under the same employer.

The net result is that locals can take on the jobs at \u201cslightly higher levels\u201d , Dr Tan said, citing findings from internal studies by his ministry on foreign workforce policies. \u201cThis has therefore informed our approach of remaining open to high quality foreign professionals while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of Work Permit holders through quotas and also levies,\u201d he said. However, there is a limit to how much the government can tighten access to lower-skilled foreign workers, due to the size of Singapore\u2019s population, Dr Tan pointed out. Continuing to do so would have a \u201cworse-off\u201d effect on Singapore\u2019s economic progress and industry development, he added. Noting that the same correlation of tightening foreign worker access and improving local employment does not apply at higher skill levels, Perera asked if this meant that Singapore is not producing enough highly skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating. Disagreeing, Dr Tan said: \u201cWe are already doing significantly more to improve on the prospects in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, in the upskilling, in upgrading.\u201d But accelerating changes have forced economies and industries to evolve rapidly, alongside other significant disruptions, he said. \u201cTo keep pace with those and to keep ahead pre-emptively, in terms of making sure that we\u2019re ahead of the competition, we will not just need to develop our own local talent, we will also need foreign workers to come alongside with us and complement us as we move forward.\u201d Dr Tan noted however that the studies \u201care but just one input to the entire policymaking process\u201d, adding that they have their limitations. \u201cFor example, they are unable to account for less quantifiable effects of having foreigners in our workplace and our workforce, such as the knowledge spillovers to locals and other network effects,\u201d he said. This means the impact of the interventions studied might also change if they are applied beyond a certain scale or at a different time period. The studies need to be interpreted carefully with other sources of information, including more recent labour market statistics and industry feedback, he said. https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/si...rkers-more-likely-improve-job-outcomes-locals",2023-02-27T13:29:15,less educated

In February, I was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. With affirmation from my financial adviser, I pursued treatment at a private practice. I began treatment and submitted my claims for my critical illness payout as well as my upgraded hospital plan's coverage. This hospitalisation coverage entitled me to claim 100 per cent of my pre-hospitalisation bills on top of the full sum assured from the life protection policy. Throughout, I held on to the assurance that my policy would ease my burdens, as my income was affected by my sickness. Five months later, the insurer rejected these claims, citing failure in disclosing my vertigo and asthma. These ailments occurred one or two years before I bought the policy, during separate one-time visits to the family clinic for dizziness and cough. I was not formally diagnosed, and I did not think these were conditions worth disclosing as there were no specialist referrals and the clinics deemed further examinations unnecessary. Hence, the insurer's reasoning baffled me. How could these two incidents alter my outcome? The insurer also took five months to process my claims instead of one to three months. I asked other insurers, who said such claims should take only up to a month to help clients in times of urgent need. I was left stranded with a whopping $100,000 in medical bills with an additional $150,000 potentially pending. After speaking to others, I realised there were many others who have fallen between the cracks and were denied adequate care by their insurer. Mismanagement of information can result in painful impacts on people's lives, and my wish is that we start valuing lives for what they are. Denise Ho Shi Yi",2021-07-22T10:58:30,income inequality

Holders of the SSB can also get their money back in any given month, with no penalty, and can earn interest that is linked to long-term SGS rates. Also, unlike bonds that pay the same coupons each year, the SSB pays coupons that increase over time. The government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are still working on the details of the SSB programme, and will release more information later. To improve the availability of corporate bonds to Singapore retail investors, MAS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) will also ease the financial and administrative costs for issuers seeking to tap the retail market, Mrs Teo said. Two new frameworks as well as a tax deduction have been proposed, and MAS and SGX are targeting to implement the proposals in the second quarter of 2015.

Her treatment cost was fully covered by national insurance scheme MediShield Life and national medical savings scheme MediSave, until December 2022, when she had to top up $268.50 in cash. This came as a shock. She has yet to receive her January bill. But she is afraid she might have to continue to pay cash every month due to the change in the way cancer treatments for subsidised patients have been covered since Sept 1, 2022. The change essentially lowered her claim limits for both MediShield Life and MediSave. The September policy change was meant to slow down spiralling cancer costs as well as to help patients better afford cancer care, including more expensive drugs. Since then, both MediShield Life and MediSave were allowed to cover only approved cancer drug treatments. Treatments not on the Cancer Drug List cannot be covered. The same will apply to Integrated Shield Plan coverage from April 1, 2023. Before the change, subsidised patients could claim up to $3,000 a month for their total cancer treatment costs. They may also use an additional $1,200 a month from MediSave. Since September, cancer treatment claims have been split \u2013 with separate claim limits for drugs and services. Patients can now claim $200 to $9,600 a month for one cancer drug treatment. They may also claim up to $1,200 a year for cancer services, which include consultations, scans, lab investigations, chemotherapy preparation and administration, supportive care drugs and blood transfusions. Up to $600 a year from MediSave may also be used. The Ministry of Health (MOH) had said that with the change, 90 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients would have their cancer bills fully subsidised, subject to the 10 per cent co-payment, which MediSave can pay for. Before the change, 70 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients had their cancer bills fully subsidised. But oncologists from the public sector have told the MOH that the $1,200 MediShield Life cap on cancer services is inadequate. Several oncologists told The Straits Times that almost half of subsidised cancer patients, who used to be fully covered, will face similar problems as Ms W. A check with various public hospitals showed that fees for a repeat consultation for subsidised patients range from $21.60 to $72.50. Lab tests, even with subsidies, often cost more than $100, and for some, will top $200. Often, these need to be done every few weeks. Some patients need medication for side effects of treatment, such as nausea or an elevated blood pressure, but such drugs also now come under cancer services. Some need antibiotics when their immune systems are compromised by the medication, and these too come under cancer services. Other procedures such as blood transfusions for patients with blood cancers also add to their costs. Several oncologists, who asked not to be named, said this is clearly not enough. One public sector oncologist said the coverage \u201cneeds to be multiple times the current cap\u201d. Ms W has no problems with cancer drug cost. It is with the cancer services that she finds her insurance coverage inadequate. By her December bill, she had used up the $1,200 yearly coverage limit for cancer services. Her bills for these services range from $400 to more than $800 each month, depending on the tests and medications she requires. The MOH said on Saturday that the MediShield Life cap on cancer services claims will be raised to $3,600 a year from April. But the cap on MediSave withdrawal for cancer services remains at $600 a year. On hearing this, Ms W said: \u201cI\u2019m glad to know that they are revising the current MediShield and MediSave coverage to better help cancer patients. I do hope that the revised amount can at least cover all the necessary tests and scans that we patients have to undergo on a frequent basis.\u201d But the higher cap \u2013 which works out to $300 from MediShield Life and $50 from MediSave a month \u2013 will still not be enough to cover her bills for cancer services. Ms W added: \u201cWith cancer, my life is already uncertain. Every time I do the test, I worry that my cancer might flare up again. Now, I also face financial problems. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to deal with it.\u201d Because of her illness, she has stopped full-time work and is currently working part-time. But this is enough to put her out of reach of MediFund aid, which is a government safety net for the poor. \u201cAt least if insurance can\u2019t pay for this, I should be allowed to use my MediSave. I may not have many more years to live. Why limit MediSave withdrawal to $600 a year?\u201d she asked. Click to expand...
