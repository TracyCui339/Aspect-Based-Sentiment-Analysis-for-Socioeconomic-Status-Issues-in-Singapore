clearly it will because it s a tough time with rising costs and economic uncertainties,  said the professor of finance, economics and real estate at the nus business school. some businesses may have to pass on these costs to consumers, he added. deloitte singapore s tax partner yap hsien yew described the announcement as possibly being  a financial burden  for businesses, especially small- and medium-size enterprises (smes) which may not have the same access to cash flow and healthy profits as larger corporations. beyond financial metrics, the impact on smes will also differ depending on the industry. those that employ more higher-income workers will feel the heat, said the association of small and medium enterprises (asme). this group will likely involve smes in industries such as technology and professional services such as accounting and auditing.  in other sectors like retail, most of the workers employed by smes are between the salary range of s$2,500 to $$4,000, which means they will not be affected in the near term,  said the association's vice-president ang yuit. phased increase to cushion impact   the phased increase in the cpf monthly salary ceiling will help cushion the impact on employers, both asme and the singapore national employers federation (snef) said. this will allow employers to ""gradually adjust and factor this increase"" into their business costs against the backdrop of slower economic growth, rising costs and a tight labour market, added snef, which has more than 3,400 members. the cpf annual salary ceiling has also been left unchanged for now, said prof agarwal, noting that this will also mitigate the impact on businesses. mr christopher gee, a senior research fellow and head of the governance and economy department at the institute of policy studies, estimates that the change in the monthly salary ceiling, when fully implemented by 2026, will result in an increase of s$2 billion to s$2.5 billion in labour costs annually . this increase would need to be offset by productivity gains to ensure it is sustainable for businesses and their workers in the long run, he wrote in a commentary. deloitte's mr yap said employers should view the announcement as helping to build a more financially secure workforce, which ultimately benefits them in the long run.  while the increase may be a financial burden in the short term, it is an investment that businesses should consider in order to reap the long-term benefits of having a financially secure and experienced workforce,  he told cna. it was also announced in budget 2023 that the government will continue with the next increase in cpf contribution rates for older workers , following the first two steps of increases in 2022 and 2023. from next year, the total cpf contribution rates for workers aged 56 to 60 and 61 to 65 will go up by 1.5 percentage points to 31 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively. the contribution rate for workers aged 66 to 70 will rise by 1 percentage point to 16.5 per cent. to mitigate the rise in business costs, employers will get a one-year offset that is equivalent to half of the 2024 increase in employer contribution rates for every singaporean and permanent resident they employ aged 56 to 70. 'a financial burden': higher cpf salary ceiling will add to businesses' woes, say associations and experts the increase in the cpf salary ceiling means that those who earn more than s$6,000   and their employers   will soon have to contribute more towards their retirement savings. www.channelnewsasia.com",2023-02-16 10:42:01,central provident fund,True,False,"singapore: the raising of the $T$ (cpf) monthly salary ceiling will add to the woes of companies already grappling with increasing costs, said business associations and experts",general

need to do more with their money to prepare for their future retirement, says david kuo of the smart investor. www.channelnewsasia.com singapore: the message from the budget 2023 speech could not have been clearer. it cannot be business as usual for singapore. over the last couple of decades, the country has benefited from global trade and finance flows. but with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. as the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. by 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. budget 2023 offers targeted support to singapore s growing pool of seniors . the eldercare fund will be topped up by s$500 million, and another s$1.5 billion will be added to the medifund. but just think about that for a moment. singapore expects a budget deficit of s$2 billion in the financial year (fy) of 2022, and a deficit of s$400 million in fy2023. those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. that is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. if we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won t need government subsidies. ensuring our retirement adequacy  as singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that singapore workers can do for themselves now. while the government has kept the rate of contributions to the central provident fund (cpf) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from s$6,000 to s$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . but this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. if so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. this number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. a 2019 lee kuan yew school of public policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in singapore is about s$1,400 a month. but considering that the median income per household member in singapore is about s$3,200 a month, which adds up to s$38,400 per year, let s work off a round figure of s$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. you can scale this up or down accordingly, but don t forget to factor in inflation. at an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our s$50,000 target would be equivalent to s$100,000 in around 24 years  time. and in 48 years  time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. that, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. that is the income we would need to generate from our savings. because we don t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the cpf special account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of s$100,000 a year in 24 years  time is s$2.5 million. we should ask ourselves if our accumulated cpf contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. if it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. that generally means investing in shares. there is a limit as to how much our cpf money can be invested in the stock market. so, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of cpf. the best time to do that is while we are young. indirect taxes prevail over direct taxes  budget 2023 also highlighted the government s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. so too will taxes on luxury cars . we can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. in the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. in the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. however, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. the upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the government to redistribute wealth. after all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. it is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. setting aside money for the next crisis  there was another important message in the budget. while the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. though singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year s budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. what s more, singapore must continue to consciously build up its reserves to prepare for the next crisis. we need to do the same too. the government has provided singaporeans with the means to cope with inflationary pressures through voucher schemes . this should help ease some of the pain when we do our daily shopping. more importantly, it buys us time to set aside some money for a rainy day because wages are rising but income tax rates aren t. it is a window of opportunity that other developed economies have been unable to provide. but we need to fix our roofs when the sun is shining. it will be too late when

 but progress singapore party non-constituency mp leong mun wai asserted that the numbers cited by mr wong did not show the true picture. not only is singapore not in a tight fiscal space, but the government s spending during the covid-19 pandemic also illustrates the strength of the country s fiscal position, he said, adding that there was  slack  in the budget. budget debate: mps raise questions about s pore s fiscal space and how to raise revenue they stress need for prudence and suggest ways to build up reserves and boost revenue. read more at straitstimes.com. www.straitstimes.com",2023-02-23 08:33:33,wealth tax,True,False," the threshold for this should be set at a suitably high level so it can be effective as a $T$ targeting those who can afford good class bungalows or afford not to rent out their secondary residential properties, he said",income

for singaporean & pr to be bond them for 3 years as registered nurse upon graduating from diploma(nursing). you will only see the contract after signing letter of undertaking for $1k of liquidated damages (ld)if you decided not to take up pcp sponsorship after nyp offer you a seat. ----------------------------------------------------------- this is the estimated estimated amount of liquidated damages upon signing deed (training allowance is $1,900 per month upon signing deed) 1st year = (course fees for 1st year + training allowance for 1st year + $150.00 uniform) x 110% = ($39,782.60# + $22,800.00 + $150.00) x 110% = $69,005.86 2nd year = (ld of first (1st) year + course fees for 2nd year + training allowance for 2nd year (to 5th year) + one-time career transition bonus) x 110% = ($69,005.86 + $39,782.60# + $22,800.00 + $2,000.00) x 110% = $146,947.31 however there is an increment of allowance from $1,900 to $2,050. so now the new estimated amount of liquidated damages is: 1st year = (course fees for 1st year + training allowance for 1st year + $150.00 uniform) x 110% \t= ($39,782.60# + $24,600.00 + $150.00) x 110% = $70,985.86 2nd year = (ld of first (1st) year + course fees for 2nd year + training allowance for 2nd year (to 5th year)\t+ one-time career transition bonus) x 110% = ($70,985.86+ $39,782.60# + $24,600.00 + $2,000.00) x 110% = $151,105.31 * remark: depending on sponsoring hospital, some will included medical checkup & injection fees for dl. for this computation of ld is without it. ----------------------------------------------------------- singapore workforce development agency (wda) stated that total liquidated damages (including full course fees, training allowances and career transition bonus) at the point of training completion could amount to roughly be $125,000 which is not the true facts! i suspected that nyp give to wda, ministry of health (moh), moh holdings (mohh) and sponsoring hospitals a estimated course fees of $39,782.60 per year to draft sponsorship contract. after nyp decided to charge $34,475.40 that year without allowing student to have subsidy like moe*tuition*grant to  sponsoring hospital. normally, a seller will give a price for the product to be consider by the buyer. however i am surprise why this work another way when the buyers (wda, moh, mohh and sponsoring hospitals) willing to buy the product before the seller (nyp) even give the actual price. during that year, full time 3 years normal diploma courses for singaporean is $19,881.60, pr is $22,695.70 & international students is $26,218.70 as non*subsidised*student for that year. so why did nyp charge a high price of $34,475.40 or unacceptable purchasing procedures without anyone like auditor general's office (ago) questioning? to add on, why singaporeans & prs are not given tuition grant for studying full-time diploma in nursing (pcp)? ----------------------------------------------------------- i have actually ask fts who are under sponsorship for 3 years normal diploma courses & their reply is they do not know their actual amount for ld. their surety are fts who mostly like their parent in their home country like china. if they run away, by right singapore government (sponsors) needs to engage lawyer at china to demand for dl payment. however i never hear any sponsors doing that. for pcp, there is no way to run cause both student & surety are local. click to expand... 3) kyoji83 said: if lecturers, assessors and course materials from nyp are not consistent, how to follow up when everything is squeeze into 2 years? click to expand... 4) kyoji83 said: i was the 4th student to dropout from my pcp-rn cohort. my senior fail his pre-registration consolidation programme (prcp) twice & now facing more problem then me. there are a lot of pcp students/graduates regret signing up. ----------------------------------- addition information to those who are interested about salary package & career advancement for pcp-rn 1) you will only know your basic salary when they offered an employment contract after you graduate from diploma. 2) sponsoring hospital claim that your non-relevant or relevant experience, nursing school results & etc will be a factor to be consider into deciding your salary package. 3) our sources from my seniors & their seniors is basic salary will be s$2,300 & those who serve ns will be s$2,500 regardless of what spell out in point 2. same route of advancement as normal diploma holders but high expectation because we are mid-career switch. as mature 'fresh rn' who have many years of non-relevant experience in workforce, we tend to be able to perform better compare to fresh rn teenagers that make it look like we have 'fast tread career advancement' which is not true. click to expand... 5) kyoji83 said: not ready to share but as you read on, you may guess something. 1) pcp students may left school many years & have family commitment compare to full time students. 2) if lecturers, assessors and course materials from nyp are not consistent. 3) while full time student are taking around 5 core modules per semester, pcp student are taking 9 core modules per semester. 4) full time student trained in nursing lab 1a & attend clinical placement 1a in semester 1 & they will take nursing lab 1b & attend clinical placement 1b in semester 2. pcp student trained in only nursing lab 1a but attended clinical placement 1a & partial 1b in semester 1. in short, pcp student are assess in clinical placement when they are not trained but during pre-clinical placement briefing, student are told not to perform skills if you are not trained. 5) it is up to assessor to ask any questions (could be from other modules like human bioscience) for nursing lab test that is not taught in nursing lab by lecturers and not shown in course materials. 6) full time student have around 40 students in a class while my pcp class have only 25 students. during nursing lab test, assessor tend to give more chance to full time students by clearing them faster such asking easiler or less questions & move on if student unable to answer. 7) if lecturers want to play you out, they will not be consistent with course materials by omitting or adding non-relevant information, procedure not in sequence & etc to your practicing/sub-group in nursing lab test. 8) a nursing lab test maybe 1 hour test with 2 skills (about 30 minutes per skill). assessor can play you out by starting the test time but stop you from doing the skills until you answer all assessor's questions in order to be 'safe' that can last up to 30 minutes or more which mean you will know that you will fail the test at that time. 9) when nyp lecturers feel that you cannot perform, some of them will start to tort you by verbal and emotional abuse to affect your mental health. they will keep harassing you by stressing the increasing huge amount of liquidated damages when you stay longer in a course and keep asking you when you intend to quit. click to expand... 6) kyoji83 said: due to limitation of pm word space, this is some of the clause that i am not comfortable with the contract. 1) for the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby agreed that any period of no-pay leave, study leave, training leave or national service shall not be counted towards the discharge of bonded period and that without exceptional reason, the sponsor shall not grant any no-pay or study leave for the purposes of further studies or sponsor any such pursuit within the first 2 years of boned period. 2) wilfully and

(whether fatal or otherwise) to any person or in respect of damage or loss to any property however occasioned, whether directly or indirectly by any act, omission, neglect or other default of the trainee while on or otherwise in relation to or arising out of the course. 6) in the event of fortuitous illness or physical or mental incapacity which, in the absolute opinion of the sponsor, renders

reason fails or is unable to complete the course, the sponsor reserves the right, by giving 1 month's notice in writing to the trainee, to withdraw or terminate the sponsorship and crease paying the training allowance, and/or benefits set out in the second schedule hereto, whereupon the trainee and/or the sureties shall jointly and severally be liable to refund the sponsor the full amount of monies expended on the trainee in respect of the course up to the date of termination of sponsorship; 7) interest at the annual rate of 10% per annum will be due and payable to the party in receipt of

deferment letter but it is up to your ns unit to approve the deferment. my classmates & my seniors were lucky to be spf nsmen. they will received their estimated ict schedule long before they received their np76 for spf nsmen (saf100 for saf & scdf100 for scdf nsmen). so they can make arrangement to reschedule their ict during school holiday for pcp student. so for those who want to sign up for

experts expect slower rise in 2023 ""european and foreign companies are genuinely considering relocating part of their business outside singapore,"" said eurocham in a press release on the survey. in his comments to today, mr donato said:  as the rental has increased by a large extent, singapore's attractiveness to businesses has likewise been harmed. ""this is the most dire it has been in the last 10 years, from our knowledge."" he added that the survey indicated that it was not just the rental costs but also growing travel and shipping costs, for example, which impose added challenges for the businesses.  eurocham and the other chambers and member companies hope that the government can intervene in the housing market to drive down the prices of rent, or implement a price ceiling,  he said. in response to today s queries on what is being done to help such firms cope with rising costs and whether the government is looking into extending them more, the ministry of trade and industry referred to a written reply to a parliamentary question last september. in the reply, trade and industry minister gan kim yong said that businesses need to ""continue to improve productivity to overcome the issue of rising costs"". he listed schemes to boost productivity such as the productivity solutions grant to support transformation efforts and the skillsfuture enterprise credit to support workers  upskilling efforts. today separately sent queries to the economic development board (edb) on when was the last time singapore experienced a significant relocation of companies to other countries, among other questions. in response, an edb spokesman said that rents in singapore are comparable to major cities. the recent rise in rents in singapore is a phenomenon also seen in other cities around the world due to pandemic-related construction delays and post-pandemic economy recovery, the spokesman added. the rental spike here is further linked to strong demand from companies and global talent to relocate to singapore, as the nation continues to draw investments from businesses seeking to tap into the growth of asia. ""our attractiveness lies in our good digital and logistics connectivity, skilled workforce as well as our vibrant innovation and start-up ecosystem,"" the spokesman said. ""we are also a liveable city and safe haven for top talent, given our world class healthcare system, education system, connectivity and rule of law."" the spokesman added that according to the ministry of national development, residential prices in singapore are expected to stabilise further as cooling measures work their way through the market and more supply comes on stream. furthermore, there are also early signs that both the resale and rental markets are slowing down. last week, edb managing director jacqueline poh also took to linkedin to comment on the sharp hikes in residential rental prices, especially in prime areas. she noted two  important facts  that are overlooked when discussing the issue.  rentals did not rise significantly for a decade before covid. (and) as a result, even now rents are comparable to many major cities, especially if you look beyond specific  hot  districts,  ms poh wrote. she concluded the post by saying that 100,000 private and public homes are set to be completed by 2025, with 40 per cent of them to be completed by this year.  this increase in supply should help relieve the pressure and moderate the cost of living.  regional cities are catching up: economist economist walter theseira said that the government has previously intervened to develop appropriate industrial spaces and support housing for foreign talent, such as via the development of jurong industrial estate and the implementation of the scheme for housing of foreign talent. however, a direct intervention in the market would risk  the possibility of harming the economy by stopping the natural flow of more value-added businesses which will displace lower value-added ones , said the associate professor from the singapore university of social sciences. one reason that singapore is expensive is the large number of businesses and people that want to be here, he said.   singapore has to be the superior choice for high value added business even with high costs. economist walter theseira from the singapore university of social sciences   regional cities are catching up in various ways such as in terms of quality of manpower, infrastructure and quality of life, assoc prof theseira said. to remain competitive, singapore must maintain  a particular niche or competitiveness so that people still want to be here  regardless of these costs, he said, giving the example of how the san francisco bay area, despite being  notoriously expensive , remains attractive to startups.  singapore has to be the superior choice for high-value-added business even with high costs,  he said. assoc prof theseira acknowledged that price rises have been too steep for comfort, posing a problem for domestic and foreign businesses alike, but he said that this is transitory because of the quick post-pandemic recovery.",2023-03-29 21:12:28,skillsfuture,True,False, he listed schemes to boost productivity such as the productivity solutions grant to support transformation efforts and the $T$ enterprise credit to support workers  upskilling efforts,occupation

""this constitutes the bulk of future commitments set aside in the reserves. as the majority of policyholders are relatively young today, the amount set aside has been increasing,"" he said. dr koh added that other such commitments include diseases currently under treatment that will require long-term care, such as renal failure and cancer. providing figures in parliament, dr koh said a total of s$7.5 billion in premiums were collected between 2016 and 2019. this comprised s$4.4 billion collected from policyholders, and s$3.1 billion from the government in terms of subsidies and other forms of premium support. in this same period, s$3.5 billion in claims were paid out, while s$3 billion was set aside for future premium rebates. the incurred loss ratio of the fund was an average of 104 per cent over the period from 2016 to 2019.

""premiums collected have to cover potential current and future payouts, including amounts set aside to support future commitments as well as provide a buffer against unforeseen contingencies such as unexpected spikes in hospitalizations due to disease outbreaks,"" he added. computing premium increases several mps raised questions relating to how premium increases are computed. in response to pap mp foo mee har s question on whether the ministry of health would  itemise  factors contributing to the premium increase, dr koh said that it is difficult to predict the technology driving clinical practice. in the past, a head injury would only warrant an x-ray of the skull, which costs about s$15 to s$20. but now, barely 20 years later, ct scans are required for head injuries, which can cost  hundreds of dollars , he said.  so as opposed to a transport fair formula where the parameters and variables are a little bit more fixed and more predictable, healthcare inflation takes into account many unforeseen kind of variables that will come along the way,  he said. while it will be hard to have a single formula with  that level of clarity , actuaries that use current data to project will make adjustments over time, and this is why the government has to review premiums on a regular basis, he added. wp mp gerald giam reiterated his question on whether the government would make the full medishield life actuarial report available, for the sake of transparency. dr koh said medishield life premiums are proposed and calculated by external actuaries who are independent from the government. the size of the funds, the amount collected and the amount paid out are also externally audited and the report will later be submitted to parliament on an annual basis, he added. however, dr koh acknowledged that the government may have to have a  better system  of looking at how the assumptions and calculations need to evolve.  over time, we could perhaps engage different consultants to take a look, to challenge the assumptions, to do another calculation at an appropriate time, to make sure that we are still on track,  he said. he added that ministry would speak to consultants on publishing some of the data  in an academic way , but emphasised that it will  not be something that most laypeople will understand .",2020-11-02 20:27:29,medishield life,True,False,"$T$ premium increases driven by rise in payouts and more claimants, says koh poh koon https://www",

which obviously will erode national cohesion and trust in government in the long run. instead of disbursing medishield-life subsidies liberally (indiscriminately) like one distracts children with cheap candies, a more targeted carrot-stick based upon health consciousness can keep overall cohort medicals claims costs low: e.g. maintaining a low % body fat (below 15% for males and below 25% for females), performing well in fitness tests (modeled after universally used military fitness test like ippt, with swimming/ cycling alternatives), non-smoking status are all very good (anti-diabetes) options to consider for substantive 'earned' waivers from the costs of premiums for compulsory medishield-life which can be implemented on a national level, as well as the total banning of the use of riders, would make the basic medishield-life scheme a more trusted medical insurance scheme whereby the concept of healthcare insurance returns to the original philosophy of insuring calamities which are unpreventable by doing everything within control to avoid the avoidable (e.g. type 2 diabetes due to sedentary lifestyle, high% body fat causing diabetes etc) . rather than a sneaky way for the rich to siphon $$$ from the poor to fund their own irresponsible and lavish lifestyles in the ultimate tragedy of the commons and let singapore go bankrupt due to the lawless, free for all, self-serving buffet syndrom mentality, the result of an extremely poorly planned and executed national healthcare insurance policy. ========================= from: https://www.facebook.com/goh.gilbert/posts/10157361126798975?pnref=story visited a 50-year-old man who skips his medical appointment twice because he could not gather enough transport money to visit the doctor. he is suspected to have initial stage of cancer of the pancreas and liver. he lost about 30 kg from his previous weight and looks jaundiced. he also owes a few months of utilities, rental and town council charges but feels most worried about the rental debts as hdb has dropped by already to check on him. he is afraid of losing the home though i assured him that so far hdb has not go hard on rental defaultors unlike purchased flat owners. surprisingly, sso has rejected his welfare application citing that he still has a son who is now working as an intern earning $1200/month. his malaysian wife is currently back in malaysia undergoing dialysis for her diabetic condition. of course, the sso wants him to get back to work but his ill health and frail body are not helping him much. he is currently awaiting approval from comcare side after visiting his mp. i left jefri after leaving him with a small amount of cash for his meals and assured him that we will assist in one way or another. a regular donor has pledged $500 to offset the $600-over rental default and someone has already paid $100 into the sp bill. at least he will have a roof over his head as he nurses his health slowly back to normal. apologise that the video is abit soft and last five minutes. poor people's campaign: a ground-up community initiative to improve the living condition of the poor among us. ======================= everyone must compulsorily conform to the concept of 'pre-funding', however, ultimately, it is the poor who paradoxically subsidise the rich since the rich (leveraging upon insurance 'riders') get to claim 60% more (even after proration is considered): reply from moh 27 nov 2013, straits times role of pre-funding we thank mr david boey (""problems with pre-funding""; nov 19), ms maria loh mun foong (""merits of pre-funding""; last thursday) and mr tan kin lian (""pre-funding not feasible for medishield life""; forum online, monday) for sharing their views on the concept of pre-funding for medishield. the letters from mr boey and ms loh may have created the wrong impression that the proposed pre-funding concept will require the younger generation to cross-subsidise the current elderly. for medishield, the pre-funded amount contributed by each cohort is set aside for the future use of their own respective cohorts , and not used to cross-subsidise the current elderly. to address concerns over affordability of premiums among the current cohort of elderly singaporeans, the government has indicated its plans to provide help for the older generation of singaporeans. as noted by mr tan, health-care costs tend to be higher for the elderly. this, plus the effects of medical advancements and changing expectations, will put further upward pressure on future premiums as we age. for this reason, it will be even more important to set aside some premiums in advance, or pre-funding, to address concerns of premium affordability during old age. with pre-funding, members pay higher premiums during their working ages and, in return, can receive rebates to offset their own future premiums when they grow old. with the ongoing review and enhancement of medishield to medishield life, one of the key issues the medishield life review committee hopes to engage the public on is increasing the role of pre-funding. the committee welcomes all singaporeans to provide their feedback or sign up for upcoming discussion sessions through www.medishieldlife.sg philip sim deputy director corporate communications ministry of health https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/pressroom/media_forums/2013/role-of-pre-funding-.html",2018-03-12 04:29:43,medishield life,True,False," ======================= everyone must compulsorily conform to the concept of 'pre-funding', however, ultimately, it is the poor who paradoxically subsidise the rich since the rich (leveraging upon insurance 'riders') get to claim 60% more (even after proration is considered): reply from moh 27 nov 2013, straits times role of pre-funding we thank mr david boey (""problems with pre-funding"";

been clearer. it cannot be business as usual for singapore. over the last couple of decades, the country has benefited from global trade and finance flows. but with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. as the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. by 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. budget 2023 offers targeted support to singapore s growing pool of seniors . the eldercare fund will be topped up by s$500 million, and another s$1.5 billion will be added to the medifund. but just think about that for a moment. singapore expects a budget deficit of s$2 billion in the financial year (fy) of 2022, and a deficit of s$400 million in fy2023. those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. that is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. if we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won t need government subsidies. ensuring our retirement adequacy  as singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that singapore workers can do for themselves now. while the government has kept the rate of contributions to the central provident fund (cpf) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from s$6,000 to s$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . but this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. if so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. this number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. a 2019 lee kuan yew school of public policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in singapore is about s$1,400 a month. but considering that the median income per household member in singapore is about s$3,200 a month, which adds up to s$38,400 per year, let s work off a round figure of s$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. you can scale this up or down accordingly, but don t forget to factor in inflation. at an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our s$50,000 target would be equivalent to s$100,000 in around 24 years  time. and in 48 years  time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. that, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. that is the income we would need to generate from our savings. because we don t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the cpf special account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of s$100,000 a year in 24 years  time is s$2.5 million. we should ask ourselves if our accumulated cpf contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. if it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. that generally means investing in shares. there is a limit as to how much our cpf money can be invested in the stock market. so, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of cpf. the best time to do that is while we are young. indirect taxes prevail over direct taxes  budget 2023 also highlighted the government s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. so too will taxes on luxury cars . we can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. in the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. in the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. however, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. the upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the government to redistribute wealth. after all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. it is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. setting aside money for the next crisis  there was another important message in the budget. while the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. though singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year s budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. what s more, singapore must continue to consciously build up its reserves to prepare for the next crisis. we need to do the same too. the government has provided singaporeans with the means to cope with inflationary pressures through voucher schemes . this should help ease some of the pain when we do our daily shopping. more importantly, it buys us time to set aside some money for a rainy day because wages are rising but income tax rates aren t. it is a window of opportunity that other developed economies have been unable to provide. but we need to fix our roofs when the sun is shining. it will be too late when thunderstorms hit. in summary, budget 2023 puts households firmly in the driving seat. the government is treating people as mature adults in a maturing economy. the country s finances are strong and should be even stronger over time. we too can make our household finances stronger over time by being prudent with our spending and preparing for future uncertainties. if we want our taxes to remain

need to do more with their money to prepare for their future retirement, says david kuo of the smart investor. www.channelnewsasia.com singapore: the message from the budget 2023 speech could not have been clearer. it cannot be business as usual for singapore. over the last couple of decades, the country has benefited from global trade and finance flows. but with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. as the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. by 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. budget 2023 offers targeted support to singapore s growing pool of seniors . the eldercare fund will be topped up by s$500 million, and another s$1.5 billion will be added to the medifund. but just think about that for a moment. singapore expects a budget deficit of s$2 billion in the financial year (fy) of 2022, and a deficit of s$400 million in fy2023. those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. that is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. if we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won t need government subsidies. ensuring our retirement adequacy  as singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that singapore workers can do for themselves now. while the government has kept the rate of contributions to the central provident fund (cpf) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from s$6,000 to s$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . but this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. if so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. this number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. a 2019 lee kuan yew school of public policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in singapore is about s$1,400 a month. but considering that the median income per household member in singapore is about s$3,200 a month, which adds up to s$38,400 per year, let s work off a round figure of s$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. you can scale this up or down accordingly, but don t forget to factor in inflation. at an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our s$50,000 target would be equivalent to s$100,000 in around 24 years  time. and in 48 years  time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. that, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. that is the income we would need to generate from our savings. because we don t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the cpf special account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of s$100,000 a year in 24 years  time is s$2.5 million. we should ask ourselves if our accumulated cpf contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. if it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. that generally means investing in shares. there is a limit as to how much our cpf money can be invested in the stock market. so, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of cpf. the best time to do that is while we are young. indirect taxes prevail over direct taxes  budget 2023 also highlighted the government s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. so too will taxes on luxury cars . we can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. in the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. in the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. however, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. the upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the government to redistribute wealth. after all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. it is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. setting aside money for the next crisis  there was another important message in the budget. while the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. though singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year s budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. what s more, singapore must

""this growth in utilisation and payout accounts for about two-thirds of the premium increases,"" he told the house. one-quarter of the premium increase comes from  refreshing  the claim limits of medishield life, while the remaining portion, just under 10 per cent,  supports the benefit enhancements , including those implemented since 2018. these include the extension of coverage to include inpatient hospices and serious pregnancy complications.  premiums have been kept unchanged for the first five years of medishield life, in line with our earlier public commitment. they need to be adjusted to ensure that the medishield life fund remains solvent and sustainable so that it can meet its obligations to all policyholders,  said dr koh. responding to a question from psp non-constituency mp leong mun wai on whether it is unusual by international standards for a health insurance scheme to increase its premiums by 35 per cent in a single adjustment, dr koh said it would not be appropriate to compare with other schemes as premiums are priced based on multiple factors  which inevitably vary from country to country . ""it would also not be meaningful to compute how much premiums a singaporean will need to pay over his lifetime simply by assuming a fixed compounding factor each year,"" said dr koh.  future premiums would depend on how the underlying drivers   evolve, and this depends on many factors including what we can achieve together to manage healthcare costs. the amount of premium subsidies an individual will receive will also vary over his lifetime, depending on his financial circumstances.  keeping premiums affordable financial support schemes are available to ensure that all singaporeans can continue to pay their premiums, said dr koh. for instance, lower- and middle-income households, as well as seniors from the merdeka generation and pioneer generation will receive premium subsidies and support.  taken together, about 35 per cent of the total premiums collected were paid for by the government through various subsidies and support schemes in 2019. for the elderly aged 65 and above, the contribution from the government is even higher, at about 50 per cent of their premiums,  he said. singaporeans can use medisave to pay for their premiums in full, and they can also use their medisave to pay for their family members  premiums as well. those who still require more help can apply for additional premium support, including those who are mid-way through medical treatment or who have recently lost their jobs and part of their income. the additional premium support will cover all outstanding and future premiums, said dr koh. in addition, singaporeans will receive a covid-19 subsidy for the next two years, which will  pay for the bulk of the premium increase in the first year , said dr koh. he noted that the government had considered deferring the medishield life review and the premium increases due to the current  difficult economic situation  with covid-19.  however, i must emphasise that it was important that medishield life remains solvent and sustainable so that it can meet its obligations in time to come when policyholders make claims. its coverage also has to be updated and enhanced to remain relevant to the healthcare needs of singaporeans,  he said. part of premiums set aside for future touching on the medishield life fund, dr koh said a portion of premiums paid by working adults is set aside to provide for future premium rebates, which will help to moderate premium increases as people age. ""this constitutes the bulk of future commitments set aside in the reserves. as the majority of policyholders are relatively young today, the amount set aside has been increasing,"" he said. dr koh added that other such commitments include diseases currently under treatment that will require long-term care, such as renal failure and cancer. providing figures in parliament, dr koh said a total of s$7.5 billion in premiums were collected between 2016 and 2019. this comprised s$4.4 billion collected from policyholders, and s$3.1 billion from the government in terms of subsidies and other forms of premium support. in this same period, s$3.5 billion in claims were paid out, while s$3 billion was set aside for future premium rebates. the incurred loss ratio of the fund was an average of 104 per cent over the period from 2016 to 2019. ""this means that the total premiums collected were slightly less than the total monies required to ensure that the fund is able to meet current claims and future commitments,"" said dr koh. he stressed that the fund has to be  self-sustaining  and based on  sound actuarial principles . ""premiums collected have to cover potential current and future payouts, including amounts set aside to support future commitments as well as provide a buffer against unforeseen contingencies such as unexpected spikes in hospitalizations due to disease outbreaks,"" he added. computing premium increases several mps raised questions relating to how premium increases are computed. in response to pap mp foo mee har s question on whether the ministry of health would  itemise  factors contributing to the premium increase, dr koh said that it is difficult to predict the technology driving clinical practice. in the past, a head injury would only warrant an x-ray of the skull, which costs about s$15 to s$20. but now, barely 20 years later, ct scans are required for head injuries, which can cost  hundreds of dollars , he said.  so as opposed to a transport fair formula where the parameters and variables are a little bit more fixed and more predictable, healthcare inflation takes into account many unforeseen kind of variables that will come along the way,  he said. while it will be hard to have a single formula with  that level of clarity , actuaries that use current data to project will make adjustments over time, and this is why the government has to review premiums on a regular basis, he added. wp mp gerald giam reiterated his question on whether the government would make the full medishield life actuarial report available, for the sake of transparency. dr koh said medishield life premiums are proposed and calculated by external actuaries who are independent from the government. the size of the funds, the amount collected and the amount paid out are also externally audited and the report will later be submitted to parliament on an annual basis, he added. however, dr koh acknowledged that the government may have to have a  better system  of looking at how the assumptions and calculations need to evolve.  over time, we could perhaps engage different consultants to take a look, to challenge the assumptions, to do another calculation at an appropriate time, to make sure that we are still on track,  he said. he added that ministry would speak to consultants on publishing some of the data  in an academic way , but emphasised that it will  not be something that most laypeople will understand .",2020-11-02 20:27:29,health insurance,True,True," responding to a question from psp non-constituency mp leong mun wai on whether it is unusual by international standards for a $T$ scheme to increase its premiums by 35 per cent in a single adjustment, dr koh said it would not be appropriate to compare with other schemes as premiums are priced based on multiple factors  which inevitably vary from country to country ",health

retirement, says david kuo of the smart investor. commentary: singapore residents must save for retirement today to continue enjoying low income taxes for direct taxes to remain low, singapore workers need to do more with their money to prepare for their future retirement, says david kuo of the smart investor. www.channelnewsasia.com singapore: the message from the budget 2023 speech could not have been clearer. it cannot be business as usual for singapore. over the last couple of decades, the country has benefited from global trade and finance flows. but with increased patriotism, protectionism and nationalism swirling around the world, singapore will have to work even harder to maintain its competitiveness. as the economy matures, retirement is an area that we should pay attention to. by 2030, which is just seven short years away, one in four singaporeans will be aged 65 or above, up from one in five. budget 2023 offers targeted support to singapore s growing pool of seniors . the eldercare fund will be topped up by s$500 million, and another s$1.5 billion will be added to the medifund. but just think about that for a moment. singapore expects a budget deficit of s$2 billion in the financial year (fy) of 2022, and a deficit of s$400 million in fy2023. those deficits would be almost erased if not for the subsidies provided to the elderly. that is another way of saying that there are no free lunches. if we want direct taxes to remain low, then we must be prepared to make provisions for our retirement, so we won t need government subsidies. ensuring our retirement adequacy  as singapore studies how else it can help seniors in community settings , there is plenty that singapore workers can do for themselves now. while the government has kept the rate of contributions to the central provident fund (cpf) unchanged, it will raise the monthly salary ceiling from s$6,000 to s$8,000 to reflect the rise in wages as a result of inflation . but this alone may not be enough for an ideal retirement for some individuals. if so, they will need to do more with their money to enjoy their twilight years. perhaps the single most important question we need to ask ourselves is how much money we realistically need to retire. this number varies greatly based on your needs and lifestyle. a 2019 lee kuan yew school of public policy study estimated that the minimum amount a senior needs for a basic standard of living in singapore is about s$1,400 a month. but considering that the median income per household member in singapore is about s$3,200 a month, which adds up to s$38,400 per year, let s work off a round figure of s$50,000 as the amount needed each retirement year. you can scale this up or down accordingly, but don t forget to factor in inflation. at an annual inflation rate of, say, 3 per cent, our s$50,000 target would be equivalent to s$100,000 in around 24 years  time. and in 48 years  time, it would need to be as much as $200,000. that, by the way, is not how much money we would need to have in our retirement pot. that is the income we would need to generate from our savings. because we don t know how long we will live, we do not want to draw down the pot and run the risk of exhausting it. taking into account the 4 per cent floor interest rate of the cpf special account , the nest egg required to generate an annual income of s$100,000 a year in 24 years  time is s$2.5 million. we should ask ourselves if our accumulated cpf contributions earning 2.5 per cent interest a year will be able to grow sufficiently to reach that target. if it is unlikely, we should invest some of our money into assets that can outpace the rate of rising prices. that generally means investing in shares. there is a limit as to how much our cpf money can be invested in the stock market. so, we may need to look beyond compulsory contributions and build another pot of money outside of cpf. the best time to do that is while we are young. indirect taxes prevail over direct taxes  budget 2023 also highlighted the government s commitment to low personal income tax with indirect taxes taking the brunt. stamp duties on high-end properties will rise. so too will taxes on luxury cars . we can argue about the benefits of indirect taxes versus direct taxes. in the case of the former, we pay taxes as we spend. in the case of the latter, the decision to spend is taken away from us through taxation. however, taxes on expensive cars and properties are unlikely to affect the mass affluent. the upshot is that raising taxes on these items can be a good way for the government to redistribute wealth. after all, that is one of the main reasons why we pay taxes. it is a means by which some wealth from those can afford it can be transferred to those who need it. setting aside money for the next crisis  there was another important message in the budget. while the pandemic has been funded by a necessary deficit, budgets must always be balanced over a business cycle. though singapore will not draw on its reserves in this year s budget, past deficits must eventually be replaced by future surpluses. what s more, singapore must continue to consciously build up its reserves to prepare for the next crisis. we need to do the same too. the government has provided singaporeans with the means to cope with inflationary pressures through voucher schemes . this should help ease some of the pain when we do our daily shopping. more importantly, it buys us time to set aside some money for a rainy day because wages are rising but income tax rates aren t. it is a window of opportunity that other developed economies have been unable to provide. but we need to fix our roofs when the sun is shining. it will be too late when thunderstorms hit. in summary, budget 2023 puts households firmly in the driving seat. the government is treating people as mature adults in a maturing economy. the country s finances are strong and should be even stronger over time. we too can make our household finances stronger over time by being prudent with our spending and preparing for future uncertainties. if we want our taxes to remain low, we need to do our part to ensure that it stays that way. david kuo is co-founder of the smart investor.",2023-02-23 09:09:32,central provident fund,True,True," while the government has kept the
