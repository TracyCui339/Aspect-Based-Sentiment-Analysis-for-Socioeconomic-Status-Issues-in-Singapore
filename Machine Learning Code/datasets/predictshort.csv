3060,"""**abstract**  this study examines the impact of government financial assistance during the covid-19 pandemic on the demand for crypto assets and the effect of crypto interest on the stated goals of stimulus programs.government lending to small businesses (ppp) significantly increased households interest in crypto assets. using a bartik instrumental variable for ppp distribution, we find that a one standard deviation increase in ppp disbursement is associated with an increase in crypto-related google searches. a 100% percent increase in ppp disbursements is also accompanied by a 2% increased number of new wallets, 10% higher trading volume, 23% higher miners revenue, and a shift from large to small addresses, suggesting that government assistance increases the demand for cryptos, particularly among new, retail investors. we further find that about 5-14% of ppp loans are diverted to crypto assets, rendering ppp less effective in maintaining employment. our results are stronger for msas with a less educated population, supporting a house money explanation.""",Reddit,2023/2/10 15:40,less educated," our results are stronger for msas with a $T$ population, supporting a house money explanation"

3126,"> a lot of conservative views tend to be based off of gut-instinct rather than a logical evaluation of how a policy will affect the average american.i think this is a complete misconception of conservative ideology, but i'll humor you: where do you think gut instinct comes from? do people feel a certain way for no reason at all? some of it is conditioning, some of it is ignorance, but often times people feel a certain way because they have life experience that has molded them to feel a certain way. it's not like people are born, take their first shit, and then decide to like lower taxes. they get their first job and see what's deducted, they are raised in a poor family and wonder what the extra money could've done for them, they never see the benefits of a government that keeps promising to help but often times doesn't have the capability. life is what teaches them this.they're not wrong in their thinking, nor would someone with a similar upbringing be wrong if they thought the opposite. but gut feelings aren't some metaphysical occurrence that isn't based in intellect or reality. it is something that is derivative of the human brain's function that tells us the way we think things should be based on inputs from events throughout our lives. reading a text book isn't much different than living for 3 months and experiencing life: both will articulate something to the user that won't usually happen otherwise. > ""for example, lowering taxes might sound good because it'll save the average american a little bit more money, but it'll cut budgets hugely for federal programs like educational grants..""kind of odd how those who are statistically in favor of higher taxes use things that are partially funded by those taxes. i wonder if there is a correlation?> college teaches people to think critically and logically and question things at first glance.if college teaches us to question things at first glance then why is it predominately leaning towards one ideology?

i would agree and those who argue it are likely wrong, but that's not where this ends, because many conservatives couldn't care less about the existence of global warming, but do care about environmental regulations.on one hand liberals want strict environmental regulations in order to preserve our planet and foster well maintained ecosystems. i would bet many conservatives, at face value, think the same way. i would actually say 99% of them do. what they disagree with is the level of regulation in accordance to promoting the economy. it is a fact that the lower the regulations are on the environment the better an economy thrives. a better economy means more jobs and a higher standard of living. are conservatives ill-educated for wanting a better economy? more jobs? no. it isn't a matter of going to college or being idiots, it's a matter of where the ideal equilibrium point is in regulating pollution and propagating economic growth. this is not something that reading a text book will solve.gun control: what will going to college change in terms of one's opinion on gun control? shooting people = bad. conservatives, again, will agree with this 99%. what they disagree with is the level to which gun availability is the cause of all this murder, or even if it is the cause of all this murder whether it really matters because when you get down to it, people are the ones killing other people. should someone not be able to have a gun because of what scumbag human beings are doing with them? i think it's arguable, but to what scale? how many deaths are too many? what guns are people being killed with? many liberals want to ban assault rifles, but aren't pistols the most popular gun in gang related deaths across the us? where's the line? college is not going to teach a conservative the objectively correct line in regards to gun control, because it doesn't objectively exist. i could go on with abortion, taxes, size of government, etc. the point is what does a college education actually change in regards to most of the issues that are up for discussion? the lines of these arguments are grey and don't have clear answers, thus someone doesn't have a ""less valid"" opinion over another because they didn't attend college.all the things i've said aren't my mainstay beliefs, but really think about what you're saying because your argument isn't really held in a lot of the points you bring up.",Reddit,2017/3/31 2:03,less educated,if college teaches us to question things at first glance then why is it predominately leaning towards one ideology?

3133,"there's a lot to unpack there. first, what data are you basing your statement that higher education tend to be more liberal? the details matter.for example, if you look at the washington post's data on [political parties year-by-year](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/interactives/independents/data-year-by-year.html), if you scroll down to the education table at the bottom you'll see democrats are much higher than republicans in the ""less than high school"" category and as you go up the education scale it shifts to republican lead for college grads and higher.this somewhat backed up by new york times [2014 exit poll data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/04/us/politics/2014-exit-polls.html?_r=0#us/2014) showing democrats tend to be the majority (55/45) for less than high school graduate but also post-graduate level (54/46), and republicans lead for all other levels of graduation by about the same ratios, including college graduates. neither of these gives the average education of democrats or republicans, but it gives a better breakdown than simple averages anyway.so i don't think it is accurate to say conservative voters are less educated. the lowest educated group tends to be democrat. the better educated tend to be republican. the highest tend to be democrat. but all of these tendencies are not big swings. 55% to 45% is not a big difference, especially since it swings back and forth based on education level. education doesn't seem to be a strong indicator of liberal vs conservative, or democrat vs republican. (also note that the washington post and ny times both tend to be left-leaning publications, so it's not like this is false data presented to portray and ideological belief.)furthermore, don't confuse education or intelligence with being correct or being less biased. knowing more doesn't necessarily translate into more objectivity or a reduction in bias. often it leads to more intricate rationalization for beliefs, not more objectivity. [this summary](http://www.globalcognition.org/intelligence-and-cognitive-bias/) of research on cognitive bias notes that the science is clear that intelligence and ""myside bias"" don't correlate. smarter people are just as prone to the biased thinking of less intelligent people.also don't confuse cause and effect. that is, it is firmly established that [professors tend to lean left highly](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-gross-academia-conservatives-hiring-20160520-snap-story.html) and conservatives feel very uncomfortable discussing their views at a much greater rate than liberals. in sciences and engineering it can range from 2:1 to 5:1 liberal to conservative, but in social sciences and humanities it can get up to 40:1 liberal to conservative. in other words, schools can actually both filter out and indoctrinate, and [even discriminate](http://yoelinbar.net/papers/political_diversity.pdf). conservatives may feel less comfortable at university and either not apply or quit, and anybody who goes through university might tend to be indoctrinated more into left-wing views and hear less right-wing views or objections. that's not the same as objectivity or being correct. in fact, the less you hear objecting views the more likely you are in an ""echo chamber"" bubble, and *more* likely to be cognitively biased, not less.i'm not sure these groupings are entirely helpful either, as many of the ""liberals"" in social sciences and humanities aren't liberal, but are more marxist and social constructionist. they might vote democrat as the more left of the two main parties in the u.s., but that confuses ""left"" with ""liberal"", which are really at right angles to each other. liberal is a measure of support of freedom, equality, and protection of rights of individuals. marxist views tend to be more authoritarian, and it is the political left on campuses pushing speech codes, banning speakers and debates on topics they disagree with, and suppressing rights in general. the liberal left is not the same as the authoritarian left, and the liberal right tend to be libertarians. (the authoritarian right tend to religious right and hyper nationalists.)there really seems to be no significant relationship between political leanings and being more *objective*, and certainly none with ideas being more *valid*.for example, the social justice left are terribly ideological and are terrible at reasoning, and are terribly authoritarian in shutting people down. (i could go into this point for hours example after example of fallacies of division, base rate fallacies, anti-science beliefs, poor statistical reasoning, and violation of the very human rights codes they claim to support. but that's not the main issue here.)liberalism vs conservatism thinking doesn't appear to be about *validity*, but about differences in balances of conflicting forces. in simplest terms, conservatives tend to focus on stability and conscientiousness, moving at the speed of evidence and ability to absorb changes. liberals tend to focus on reaching goals and openness to new experiences based on the idea. (e.g., see [here](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cdeyoung/pubs/hirsh_2010_a_politics_pspb.pdf).) that is much faster. too much conservatism keeps things sluggish and stagnant with less improvement. too much liberalism creates instability and collapse without thinking through the issues or working out good solutions first, or having patience to bring people around to a different way of thinking first before forcing it on them. it isn't that one of them is right or wrong, but that they are [complementary leanings of multiple factors](http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/papers/ghn2009.pdf). imagine driving a car without any damping in your suspension. imagine driving without any responsiveness. both would be terrible. a smooth ride comes from the right balance, not from picking one side or one component and maximizing it.these different ways of thinking seem related to [brain structure](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/09/07/your-brain-on-politics-the-cognitive-neuroscience-of-liberals-and-conservatives/). you are actually probably committing the very acts described here, using whatever reasoning or evidence you can find to support your pre-defined belief (confirmation bias) that liberals are right and conservatives are wrong.but the evidence just doesn't support that view. liberal vs conservative has nothing to do with being correct. liberals are as prone to bias as conservatives.

regard liberal arts(a significant proportion of liberal leaning people, obviously) as useful or properly educated and if anything, is a detriment to competence within the workforce.college does not teach people to think critically, this is something that is done from within and learned/taught individually. most socialistic school systems and generic college courses or liberal arts programmes do little to teach people how to think critically, think from perspective of devils advocate/opposition, or how to prepare them for the adult world/life.but if you want to think about what society has a tendency to think people as smart then yes liberals will have a tendency to be in environmental science fields and liberal arts degrees. to a conservative standpoint necessarily make you smarter because you have these. it doesn't make you smarter if you cannot be bothered to challenge pre-existing notions, and is ironically conservative to accept what is in science to parrot what previous scientists have deemed as ""most correct"" at the time. you are given a scale based on what liberals deem as smart. preconceptions are biased all around.to many in conservative circles nasa is a huge waste because government shouldn't hold monopoly on scientific research and development. and government involvement may be why nasa got a huge boost in the 60s for a decade, but is also why nasa was largely defunded and ineffective for over half a century.in statistics conservative leaning types tend to be in high places of power because of the nature of what it is to be conservative. those that are conservative are more akin to maintaining and controlling, hence conservative. liberals have a tendency to be better at introducing new ideas, as is obvious. but they do no have a tendency to be able to implement and structure those new ideas for integration into pre-existing ideals.there is no such thing as a job that is unwanted as people will work if there is availability. if you are referring to jobs that illegals would acquire as under-the-table and possible untaxed work, that is an illegal job. those jobs aren't supposed to be available to a regular citizen. a point, that may be irrelevant; but to a conservative they matter not because of feelings but because both facts and personal accounts point to illegal immigration being a problem. not exactly sure how this is relevant to the main talking point.a standpoint that possibly both parties can agree on is that a country is not a country if it has no borders. conservatives also have a tendency to be hard working people, there is no monopoly on such a thing. they represent manual labour the same. the blue collar workers that are the backbone of the economy. they are also representative with those with the

library for a few hours and pretending to study and wasting time on reddit/facebook like many of us. these people are insane and they make it to the top because they are the best and they simply put more hours in that regular people. doctors, lawyers, management, business, politics, engineers. just because there are fewer of them since they are supposed to be limited and competitive doesn't mean

there is significance in attitude.> a lot of conservative views tend to be based off of gut-instinct rather than a logical evaluation of how a policy will affect the average americanthis may be sometimes perceived as the case. but its my understanding that the left leaning parties have a tendency to also base things on how they feel rather than what evidence points toward. **they feel** as

feel like they are negative rather than actual actually looking at evidence those models predict. **they feel** like trump is a terrible person because of how he acts/says rather than what he does.

actively involved in selling weapons to isis and while he withdrew troops, he spent exponentially more in drone bombing with liberal collateral damage. **they feel** like helping out refugees by bringing them here where they are safer when actuality its more expensive and far less effective than giving them assistance and resources where they originated. **they feel** like conservatives are gun toting dangerous people when in actuality most crime occurs in democrat leaning cities. **they feel** like guns are problematic and dangerous when they are merely tools, when educated are both a right and is necessary and useful, and so they wish to impose arbitrary regulations which do nothing but inconvenience and restrict average law abiding citizens. **they feel** like things are offensive to them and thus they are entitled to special treatment accordingly. **they feel** like anger and violence is justified if you paint the enemy as evil. **they feel** the race card is applicable only when it is useful to them. **they feel** they are entitled to another person's work because its sad when people are hurt.  **they feel** like women don't have enough rights even though womens' rights were fought for long ago. **they feel** like women deserve more rights when currently women already have more rights than men socially, just because they had less in the past even though current women have nothing to do with the past. **they feel** like they want to help black communities by giving into their rage rather than building up communities, educating, and giving opportunities. **they feel** like facts are important but shun facts and statistics as soon as it doesn't support their feelings. **they feel** like they are better educated because their culture/communications/gender studies/basket-weaving degree told them so. **they feel** like they need to help people by throwing money at them instead of presenting them opportunities to better

simple principles that there should be less government control in peoples' lives. many of these policies may seem damning or even cold, but the end result is hopefully less reliance on the government

and foreign.in the end they (are supposed) to want what is best for you. conservatives and republicans are not immune from corruption though.from the viewpoint of conservatives, they may deem federal programmes as largely unnecessary and if anything leads to inefficiencies, especially in the long run. they often lead to many middleman handling of funds or permissions or communications that causes lack of efficiency. in many ways things that should be handled or could be handled better by people locally, or within the state, or within capitalistic motivation. and that government involvement should be minimal and only used for emergency. they would rather; if necessary for involvement, to teach people to fish rather than give people fish.simple viewpoints: stability > new forced

3269,"general issue, so nothing against the authors here. in fact, they partially acknowledge this in their discussion of mechanisms, especially the fact that cognitive ability did not seem to explain their genetic result. still, with all these genetic studies of complicated social/cognitive behaviors, the phenotype is mediated by an inescapable cultural paradigm that dictates how people with certain heritable traits are positioned in society, which then predictably affects their behavior.the most obvious example here is skin color, which these studies may gesture at by attempting to correct for a (biologically vague at best) race/ethnicity variable. but height, eye color, hair color, bone structure, musculature, metabolic factors, and many other heritable traits probably also affect social standing, and they're inadequately captured by the race variable as it's usually defined. your social standing then affects many things in your developmental environment - not to mention your general stress/cortisol levels - which affect how you think and behave. then, a genetic association is reported with that trait and is interpreted as a direct effect: a ""gene for"" some cognitive/behavioral characteristic.occam's razor notwithstanding, the only direct* effect of a dna variant is on rna sequence. once you get to voting or educational attainment, everything is mediated by many environmental factors.let's use height and civic participation as an example. we know height can affect what people think of your leadership abilities, which we'd expect would affect your motivation for civic participation. but is a gene controlling femur length a ""civic participation"" gene variant? unless you control for height, you could easily call it that in your aggregated genomic analysis. and the same goes for every other physical characteristic affecting how people see each other. i'll share an anecdote that i think also illustrates this: my college classmate grew a beard during his semester in morocco, because people found him more trustworthy that way. i'd be surprised if some facial hair thickness genes didn't eventually show up in some genetic association with prosocial behavior under those conditions. but you wouldn't see that effect in cultures where shaving is the norm, so calling these ""genes for"" such behavior is missing the main - and much more actionable - cultural causal relationship. it certainly doesn't prove that trust-building is an inescapable genetic trait.some people whose rational approaches to other subjects i respect seem to be jumping to a ""genetic destiny"" story based on studies like this, when in reality there are genotype-by-environment effects that are not adequately accounted for. it may not even be possible to account for them, because they could shift as a result of sufficiently clear description. on top of that, the best genetic techniques (e.g., complementation, transformation, test-crosses/controlled mapping populations, clone assays under tightly controlled developmental environments, etc.) are impractical and unethical in humans. so maybe it's not possible to do precise genetic studies with these human behavioral traits. but then, to quote feynman, you can't claim to know anything about it. certainly not enough to structure policy decisions. for those, it's better to stick with the null hypothesis that we are all created equal. in addition to reflecting an honest level of intellectual humility regarding human nature, it focuses policy on those societal factors (education, systemic bias, unequal policing) that policy can actually affect.*and even that only shows up under active transcription",Reddit,2021/12/13 15:02,educational attainment," once you get to voting or $T$, everything is mediated by many environmental factors"

3304,">however conservatives often point out that asian students, who also face racial discrimination, fare much better than their classmates (including whites) when it comes to grades and test scores.the better point of comparison is recent nigerian immigrants.the median annual income of nigerian diaspora households was about $7,000 more than that of the average us household.  they are 163% more likely to have a graduate degree than the average american. nigerian accounts for less than 1 percent of the black population in the united states, yet, they make up nearly 25 percent of all black students at harvard business school.what us this tell us?it isn't about skin color.  the racial gap is the confluence of two major factors: cultural and economic resources.from an economic standpoint, virtually every black person in america has been systematically deprived of economic opportunity from the the day of their birth. their parents, their grandparents, and their more distant relatives were all prevented from passing down any residual wealth.  we have not yet seen a generation of black people where the majority will pass down their homes.  slavery is obviously one mechanism for this, but it is not by any means the most recent.  sharecropping, convict leasing, redlining, reverse redlining, and even the outright destruction of black centers of wealth have impoverished black america.  black tulsa was burned to the ground.  [black atlanta was burned to the ground.](https://www.britannica.com/event/atlanta-riot-of-1906#:~:text=white%20mobs%2c%20inflamed%20by%20newspaper,the%20actions%20of%20the%20mobs.)    &c.  there has never been a generation of black americans that has been able to stand up and just build wealth without their legs being taken out from under them.  because of this, there has never been a generation of black americans whose *parents* have been able to build and pass on wealth.the richest nigerians, the ones who can immigrate to america, don't have this history.  they come with wealth, degrees, economic support.  they can pass on their wealth to their children.  they can enroll them in daycare and pre-k.  they can work a single job and return at 5 to be with their family.   that culture emerges *from* circumstances, it isn't independent.  and that goes to cultural resources.  black america is suffering from one endemic that cannot be simply withstood.  the rampant overpolicing and oversentencing of black men has left black households splintered and destroyed black communities.  66% of black families are single parent households.  some of this is a nation-wide trend, as the percentage of white children living in single parent households tripled from 7% in 1960 to 22% today, but the factors unique to black america make it even harder for them.and at the same time that black men are far more likely to face judicial discrimination, black children are far more likely to enter the school-to-prison pipeline.  many times, this is for behavior that is tolerated for kids of other races.overall, the racial achievement gap is exactly what you'd expect when a population is systemically stripped of the resources it needs to raise its children in an environment of enrichment and structure.",Reddit,2022/9/28 23:58,achievement gap,"overall, the racial $T$ is exactly what you'd expect when a population is systemically stripped of the resources it needs to raise its children in an environment of enrichment and structure"

3385,"over all, girls outperform boys in school. it starts as early as kindergarten. by the time students reach college, women graduate at a higher rate than men.but theres an exception. asian-american boys match the grades of asian-american girls in elementary school, a new study has found. for them, the gender achievement gap doesnt appear until adolescence  at which point they start doing worse as a group than asian-american girls.the study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that boys underperformance is not because of anything innate to boys. instead, it seems, its largely because of something external: their school environments and peer influences.girls are encouraged to be diligent, cooperative and ambitious  all things that serve them well in school. boys are more sensitive than girls to environmental influences, according to a variety of research, and they feel pressure to be strong, tough and athletic. they get the message that doing well in school is not masculine, social scientists say. even in peer groups that prize good grades, its considered uncool to seem to try hard to earn them.asian-american boys are somehow sheltered from that message in early childhood. the reasons could give parents and teachers information about how to help boys of all races reach their full potential.these findings show it doesnt have to be this way, that boys necessarily have to underachieve, said amy hsin, the papers author and a sociologist at queens college in new york. how we parent, how we help children think about their masculinity, and school culture and peer norms have effects on their performance in school.looking at grade point averages of white and asian-american students, she found that unlike white students, asian-american boys and girls have no significant grade differences until ninth grade. then, boys fall behind girls by the equivalent of one-third of a letter grade, about the same as the gender difference in white students grades, according to the new study, published last month in the journal sociological science.it used data on about 9,200 white and 1,700 asian-american students from two national studies that followed the same students over time (the groups were too small to analyze differences among asian ethnic groups.) the results are not definitive. the sample size is relatively small, and the analysis uses grades, which, unlike test scores, are influenced by teachers subjective assessments of students. yet the results fit with other research that shows the effect of outside influences on academic performance, particularly for boys.one reason asian-american children do so well as a group is that asian immigrant families tend to be very focused on education, as the sociologists jennifer lee and min zhou described in their book, the asian american achievement paradox.one goal of a 1965 u.s. immigration law, which also abolished severe restrictions against immigration from regions such as asia, was to give preference to professionals with specialized skills. partly as a result, a little more than half of chinese immigrants to the united states have a college degree or higher, versus less than 10 percent of adults in china, ms. lee said. they have tended to prioritize that their children earn straight as; attend a good college; and become a doctor, lawyer, scientist or engineer, the authors wrote. they have also shared information about things like sat tutors and a.p. courses with their less educated asian-american peers.another factor is the so-called model minority stereotype  that asians as a group are supposed to be smart, successful and hard-working. this image masks high poverty and dropout rates among some asian ethnic groups, yet as with all stereotypes, it can lead people to act in biased ways. teachers tend to give asian-american students higher grades and funnel them into advanced programs, the researchers found. often, lower-performing students have risen to meet these expectations of them, an effect social scientists refer to as stereotype promise.for asian-american boys, these influences change in adolescence, ms. hsin found, a time when children become more aware of their gender identity and are more influenced by peers. they also have to fight a pernicious perception that they are not masculine enough.the model minority myth frames asian boys as being kind of nerdy, caring too much about doing well, so that may cause them to become less academically attached, ms. hsin said. its not as stigmatizing for asian girls because if youre good at school and you really care, that kind of plays along with what you should be doing as a girl anyway.the new study offers a clue about how much school environments affect boys academic achievement. ms. hsin found that the gender gap for asian-americans in high school was smaller in schools that were less sports-focused, and where boys did better over all.other studies have also pinpointed the importance of the school and social environments, especially for boys.one working paper found that the best-performing students had a combination of behaviors typically considered male and female. it used nationally representative survey data about gender norms for about 12,000 high school students, linked with their high school transcripts. the most traditionally feminine girls and the most masculine boys had the lowest grades.the messages boys receive about how to be masculine come from local influences in their schools and communities and are often tied to to socioeconomic status, other research has shown. boys perform better in school when achievement is considered to be desirable, and when they believe successful men get their power from education versus strength and toughness. boys in high-income communities are more likely to get those messages, research has shown.teachers expectations of students  and the biases behind them  also influence childrens performance. for example, white teachers are less likely than black teachers to refer black students to gifted programs, or to have high expectations for their potential. yet as with asian-american students, research shows that when teachers have high expectations for black students, they rise to meet them.the fact that boys achievement varies in different school environments is a hopeful sign for parents and educators, ms. hsin said, because it suggests ways to help all students.encourage academic achievement, she said, and talk about how it leads to success.researchers have other suggestions. show them role models who got where they are by doing well in school. emphasize the importance of hard work and daily practice, not innate skill. encourage both boys and girls to embrace a full range of character traits, and not to feel limited by stereotypical gender roles. place high expectations on children, and give them opportunities to meet them  regardless of skin color.",Reddit,2019/1/15 17:02,achievement gap," for them, the gender $T$ doesnt appear until adolescence  at which point they start doing worse as a group than asian-american girls"

3438,"as an insider in the health system (surgical registrar), this is my opinion on hospital cover. private health insurance should be referred to as private hospital insurance. medicare pays for 75%, the insurer pays 25% of the medicare scheduled fee for inpatient treatment. sometimes the insurer will pay a bit more if the proceduralist agrees to charge a known gap (e.g $500) or no gap. waiting times:no waiting list for elective procedures. in the public, operations are categorised as 1 month, 3 months, 12 months priority. for something like cancer, thatll be categorised as a one month procedure. things like uncomplicated hernias or knee replacements are placed on 12 months. often waiting lists blowout and waits are longer. in the emergency setting, private health insurance makes very little difference. you will not get special treatment. priority is based on clinical urgency. anyone with more life threatening issues will push in line. however if the proceduralist happens to have a list with availability at the private hospital and your problem is suitable to be managed there, then it opens the option to have the operation done there. who does the operation:(surgery doctor hierarchy from most junior to senior is: intern, resident, senior resident, unaccredited registrar, accredited registrar [in the college of surgeons training program], fellow [completed accredited training and now subspecialising], consultant)private: the consultant surgeon will generally perform the operation in either elective or emergent setting. however, with consent a registrar or fellow may do it. public: a registrar or fellow may perform the operation under supervision (with the consultant scrubbed, in theatre or available). registrars/fellows are only allowed to do operations that they are competent with. if the complexity exceeds their skills, the consultant will be doing the operation regardless of insurance status. studies have shown no significant difference in outcomes and complications in operations done by registrars when under the supervision of a consultant. infrastructure:public hospitals are generally better equipped than private hospitals (e.g more infrastructure, more specialties, more after hours staff, more like to have accredited training registrars as opposed to service/unaccredited registrars or residents)if your procedure is complex, it is likely to be done in a public hospital, regardless of insurance. fees:private: there is the excess to access the insurancethere is likely to be a gap payment to the consultant in the elective setting. it is etiquette to not charge a gap in the emergent setting, however they are entitled to. there may be associated fees for medications, physiotherapy, radiology imaging. with the medicare schedule of fees not keeping up with inflation and costs (rent, staff, utilities), it is likely the gap payment will continue to increase. sometimes it exceeds the payment from medicare and the insurer. public. there will be no fees charged for your inpatient care. the effect on inpatient care for non procedural specialties: negligible difference between public and private outpatient care: as legislation stands, health insurers cannot pay for outpatient care. this includes chemotherapy/radiotherapy which is mostly outpatient. tax:if you earn above the medicare threshold, often private health insurance is less than the medicare levy surcharge. extras: only worth it if you were always going to utilise services such as dental / optical etc and the payouts

3448,"alright, my time to shine. lots of people have said some good things here and as you can probably see, it's all very situational and personal. i am currently going through my own medical stuff at the moment so am quite across this.the first part:\- how much money you make: there will be a threshold where your medicare levy surcharge will be more expensive than some forms of phi. this is where you will want phi even to just save some money.\- lifetime health cover loading will also come into play once you are past 30 years old. do the math with this, alongside the above mls against your income and if phi is than i think your answer is clear.the second part:\- phi will offer you hospital cover & extras cover. unless you are very very active or need active health monitoring, forget the extras cover. \-  phi hospital cover is now standardised across all companies into 4 tiers ""basic"", ""bronze"", ""silver"", ""gold"". they are pretty much the same across all companies. ""basic"" will literally give you nothing apart from ticking your checkbox that you have phi which will exempt you from the mls referenced above. this may be your choice if for whatever reason you really don't want phi but you don't want to be paying more taxes because of mls/lhc, then the ""basic"" is your best option. but i would recommend against ""basic"" because...the third part:\- as many have said, you pay for health insurance as exactly it's name says: ""insurance"". you don't need it until you need it. \- i have had phi for about 10 years now, but have always been on the ""basic"" plan. i have a semi-urgent condition that requires surgery. my surgeon can do both public & private. at first we were going to go public, but due to the hospital being under strain from covid, we have to go private. this is something i cannot stress more. in a post-covid world, there will be naturally more admittance to the hospital and this will take up more beds and require more staff, which will naturally make elective surgery much, much harder to prioritise into the public system. i am a category 2 patient (listed as semi-urgent) and that can be anywhere form 4-12 weeks waiting.\- we then looked at some private hospitals that the surgeon also can operate it. but unfortunately due to my ""basic"" level of phi cover, i am essentially covered for nothing. that means the surgery is $8-12k off the bat (doctors, registrars, anesthetist, the tools etc.) but then the hospital stay ($1.3k/night for a shared room, $1.5k/night for a private room, and if something happens in the surgery that requires you to be in icu, that is $5k/night). it would roughly equate to $30-50k in it's entirety and you won't know exactly until you are approved to go home, because anything can happen in surgery (you have a blood clot, you react badly to something etc.)\- because of how insane those costs were, i decided to just wait out the 4-12 weeks at the public hospital. i immediately went to switch my ""basic"" phi cover to ""silver"" phi cover to not repeat this mistake (as i will be having future surgeries). unfortunately my condition is quite painful, so i will just have to put up for that duration of pain. i would recommend a mid-to-high tier of hospital cover because it will help prevent any sudden surprises. if you have a low-to-mid and then have surgery, your phi may cover some certain stuff but not others. it kind of sucks that way, so i personally think - if you are going to get phi hospital cover, just go the highest you can afford.\- public & private is not mutually exclusive. if you have phi, you have the option of being admitted at a private hospital as a private patient, at a public hospital as a public patient (and not use your phi), or a public hospital as a private patient (and using your phi). if you do not have phi, you only have 1 of those options.\- again, yes: if you have cancer, or in really, really bad shape. you will go into the public hospital immediately and it will be free. that's category 1. but if you have anything else, you are category 2 or 3 and will be waiting. how much are you willing to wait in a post-covid world? do you have pain, or something to stop you from working or living your life? will being on the waiting list actually cause you to die? these are real things.apologies for the brain dump, i just learnt all of this in the last 2 months but this is important knowledge for you to know whether or not it's ""worth it"" for you. only you can make that decision. but personally, i would recommend it. get a mid/top-tier hospital cover, no extras and when something happens to you you just have to (mostly) worry about your health and not the finance side of it.",Reddit,2023/2/1 6:29,health insurance,"the third part:\- as many have said, you pay for $T$ as exactly it's name says: ""insurance"""

3486,"private health insurance in this country is like a 10-lane freeway approaching a bank of manned toll booths. (old-fashioned mixed metaphors ahead, but hear me out).lanes 1-5 are for everyone and anyone in the public health system and the speed you're driving at is dictated by the number of doctors, nurses, allied health staff, and medical admin staff manning your toll booths. if you're queuing for one the 10 hospital booths, you pay no toll. if you're queuing for one of the 20 gp booths, 16 of them have a toll and 2 of them are free. the other 2 are manned by consultants who also work half the of time in the free hospital booth and the special fees are exorbitant. obviously the queues for the free booths are much longer than the paying booths, and some people cut into the hospital booth when they had already been lining up for the gp queue. sometimes because it took too long to get to the front and sometimes for other reasons.lanes 6-8 are for those people with private, and there are far fewer people in the lanes to start off with. but you have to pay a fee to jump into these lanes, and when you get to the front of the queue, you still have to pay a hefty toll. there are lots of enticements to jump into these lanes. some of them are limited to customised numberplates, others give you a new windscreen every year, and some of them will give you a brand new car every year just to drive there. there are special crews of workers to ensure that potholes are attended to quickly. the queue to get to the front is much much faster, and your toll booth selection is often much greater, with promises that you will always get to choose which toll booth you go through. they also say that if you wait too long in the regular queue it'll cost you even more to cut in later on. but the thing is that there is a finite number of staff available for these toll booths, and the more people who start going through them, this will ensure that there are fewer people who can man all the public booths. making the queues in the public lanes even longer than before.and finally there is are lanes 9 and 10 which are reserved for hospital emergencies. there are no fees at the booth, and they are manned by the best of the available staff, some of whom also work in the private lanes and all of whom work in the public hospital lanes. you don't get to choose if you go into these lanes, only the toll booth attendants do. it doesn't matter which lane you came from, you don't pay to use the emergency lanes (but if you tell them you came from the private lanes, will be charged as if you were still in your original lane). the busier these lanes are, the longer the public hospital queue is, as they are manned by the same people. the problem with the whole system is the same as that with any large freeway with visibly different speeds in different lanes - people want to go to the lane that's the fastest. even at the expense of people who are driving vehicles which are slow or old or breaking down. there are broken down cars on the side of the freeway with all the people whose cars didn't get them to the front in time. and this scares lots of people to jump into the faster lane. because there are far fewer broken down cars in the private lanes. (the roadcrews are there to tidy up). people are actively encouraging you to jump lanes by promising that your car rego will be cheaper in the private lanes. but it's not cheaper because all the extra staff and roadwork crews and air-conditioned lanes mean that the cost of the private lanes is higher overall with fewer users. the other problem with fast moving lanes and queue-jumping is that for everyone who gets to the front faster, it slows down the merge ahead and makes the queue even longer and slower for those people who are lining up in the public lanes.the government pays for the whole freeway, the cost of training all the booth attendants, the bitumen, paint, everything. a portion of everyone's rego goes to the government to pay for the whole freeway, but the private lane operators promise that your rego will be free if you pay for the extra lane maintenance fees, which are usually about the same as the cost of rego, sometimes a bit less. if you go to the private lanes, the extra costs which the individual driver pays doesn't go back to the government who owns the whole freeway and who built it many years ago, but goes instead to the subcontractors who operate those lanes.the morality of this three-tier system is questionable, because people are encouraged only to take care of their own car rego, and are even actively encourage to minimise their official  rego costs. this means that the freeway operators have decreasing income and can't fix the freeway as it's being used without closing off whole lanes, leading to ever more cars overheating and breaking down because they are waiting in their queue for longer than their car can handle. if there were only two types of lane, a more equitable distribution of toll booths, and everyone paid their rego fairly, the whole system would be a much better experience for 99% of freeway users, the wait times for all the toll booths would reduce, and breakdowns would be fewer.",Reddit,2023/2/1 6:29,health insurance,private $T$ in this country is like a 10-lane freeway approaching a bank of manned toll booths

3511,"obamacare changed the regulated healthcare market (stay far away from the garbage offered by ministry cost sharing plans). all the regulated plans need to cover the same core services and have unlimited liability for lifetime care costs (so preexisting conditions no longer matter). you typically get 2 options:hmo - insurance controls your care. you must follow their rules. you just use their network doctors. ppo - your plan will pay claims from any doctor and you can go to any doctor but will pay more probably. that means by and large all the plans work the same! if its an hmo, they pretty much all work the same. if its a ppo, they pretty much all work the same. the difference is the numbers and the network and stuff, not the insurance product. this makes is very easy to compare plans compared to how it used to be. -no matter what plan you select and what trade offs you make, there are a few numbers to know and weigh against each other:premium -> this is how much you pay each week or month. typically pretax money. deductible -> how much you pay for any covered service (except an annual physical and like covid vaccines) before the insurance pays anything. coinsurance -> the formula that explains the cost sharing once your deductible is maxed. 60/40,70/30,80/20,90/10,100/0. one of those will be it. insurance will pay the larger number. you pay the smaller number. until you hit the out of pocket max. out of pocket max -> the amount after which the insurance pays for any covered service 100% without any cost to you until the end of the year. what i do: i think the only numbers that actually matter are the premiums and the out of pocket max. i often choose an hdhp that qualifies for an hsa and then can sock money away pretax for that account. and then, if for some reason i need to pay medical bills, i can pay them pretax even if i put the money on the account years ago and didnt need to use it. health insurance is a bet on your health in the next year. if you know youre on very expensive medications you can choose a plan that has a combined or separate pharmacy deductible, depending on what you like, which can better control your costs in that case. etc. i think most people overpay for insurance. they select plans with lower deductibles than they really need and overpay in premiums. if we compare some plans, you can see how this is, mathematically, kind of silly:heres plan option 1: https://mrstaxbenefits.com/forms/benefit%20summaries/medical/2021/full_ppo_savings_embedded_deductible_5500_2021%20(1).pdfheres plan option 2: http://www.aclevidence.com/uploads/5/7/2/0/57207605/full_ppo_combined_deductible_value_25-2500_80-50.pdfso both of these plans cover the exact same things. the only difference is the premium and the cost structure before the out-of-pocket max is hit.  my cost in premiums for the first plan with 5500 deductible is $2900 for the year in payroll costs for 1 participant. my cost in premiums for the second plan with 3000 deductible is $7248 for the year in payroll costs for 1 participant. why would anyone in their right mind choose the second plan? well, they could have a surgery scheduled soon or expect they will have a lot of costs coming up in the new year right away but expect them to stop midway through the year i guess, but thats unlikely. the out of pocket max is basically the same in these plans between $6500->$7000. and they pretty much cover the same stuff. the expensive one starts paying out sooner. but its a worse deal. choose hdhps but understand them first. for most people they work out better. especially younger people. premium cost delta is $4300. i mean. for the cost of your annual premium payments to your insurer, if offered the choice above like i was this year, your out of pocket max is the same so. i just expect i will hit the oop max if something goes bad and optimize for best coverage at lowest premiums. if the oop max is the same between plans, i mean, why would i choose the one that guarantees i pay a lot versus the one that does not? your employers subsidies and plan offerings can make this choice easier or harder sometimes. but the basic point remains: out of pocket max and premiums paid are what matters in most cases. that controls your knowns. you know youre paying premiums. and you know that if shit hits the fan you can get the same coverage under obamacare.",Reddit,2023/3/3 22:15,health insurance, $T$ is a bet on your health in the next year

3551,"i just dealt with this situation with the mail with my mom last year. she went so far as to open my mail, destroy my husbands (which almost put us into medical debt because we almost didn't get the bill.) and opened my tax returns and handed them back to us naked. for the medical aspect, if you're making money for yourself, i'm assuming by working at goodwill. you can use a website called sidecar health. husband and i have never had a marketplace health insurance. we customized our own plan. we used sidecar for him when he had unknown stomach pains and had to see too many doctors a month. cost us 140 a month. its an indemnity plan so what it does is. you go to the doctor with it, any doctor you want, (except for dentist, eyes and pregnancy). sidecar sends you a physical card like a credit card in the mail.you tell them you are self pay, they may give you a self pay discount. you use the sidecar card to pay for the visit.any office visit for whatever reason, you do the visit, sidecar will cover 80% of the total cost based on whatever fixed price their website has for a typical similar office visit. you ask the office for an itemized  bill that you will then take a picture of, put it into the sidecar app and submit as proof of the visit. and sidecar will reimburse you for any money if their estimate went over what you actually paid. this includes therapy. 75$ visit for my husband was knocked down to 15$.the only issue is that because sidecar has a fixed rate for what they pay, 80% regardless of the appointment type, it's entirely dependent on where you go what price you pay. so if a doctor says 280 one place, and 320 for a procedure somewhere else,, 80% is 80%. so the amount you pay is dependent on the doctor you see. so better to use it for small family clinics than going to the hospital for major things tbh.",Reddit,2023/3/30 5:59,health insurance, husband and i have never had a marketplace $T$

(it was a bad year.) if i earned more i'd get less aid. the state is kicking in some $400 bucks per month to help cover this ridiculous policy that bassically is for catastrophic use only. if i get hit by a bus or have a heart attack, i will only have to pay the first $6,800 and then they'll pay 80%. so, i can tell you now. if i get cancer or have a heart attack, i will just tell them do not resuscitate. just let me expire. i can't afford to pay the $30-90k it will cost to get me out of the hospital. i am already a month behind on my rent since october and i am surprised my landlord has not evicted me. between medical costs, rent, reduced salary power/ inflation and the cost of living disparity between what i make and what it costs to live. not living is actually cheaper and at this point far less stressful and a ton more appealing. i am so tired of not having a life and not being able to take a vacation or do anything not work related. and my friends in europe? ?they are traveling constantly and they are not rich. they have regular jobs and make less than i did. but they own their homes. travel abroad. buy new cars every few years and are always posting pics of their weekends away. they work to live... they do not live to work. which is what we in the us have become. we are a working state and holidays are only for the upper 2% of our population. that a french school teacher can take a 4 week vacation to fiji to go scuba diving during her summer recess, pretty much says it all. she stayed with a local family, not in a hotel, but most us teachers are working during the summer to keep food not he table and not let the debt pile up too high. i know this was a reply to the post of the insurance loss, but the fact that we do not have millions of people marching in the streets demanding change is a joke. people will march for the rights of others, for the rights of guns and abortion... but when it comes to the fundamental right of being able to live and have access to medical care? they somehow does not rile people up and everyone just shrugs and goes about their day... that to me is the headline. but i digress... oh, by all means. let's start a go fund me to help poor ke huy quan who lost his his health insurance... what about the millions of others who also lost their last week?",Reddit,2023/3/3 13:24,health insurance, let's start a go fund me to help poor ke huy quan who lost his his $T$

3852,"so, the thing about group health insurance is that it is a weird kind of insurance because some of the benefits are optional. the premiums go up every year because  the insurance company is spreading the individual healthcare costs over the group, and spreading costs over the year. if your group uses $200,000 worh of heathcare this year, then next year everyone in the group will pay ""premiums"" equivalent to $200,000 plus expenses and profit for the insurance company. so, the people who benefit are the people who use their health care. it is good for me because i have child living with a disability, and i use up a lot of his benefit categories, but the fact that i am using benefits means that someone within my group who is healthy, pays a bit more for their insurance. if you just go for a massage once or twice a year, you are probably pulling more than your share right now, but the benefit, of course, is that you will not have a sudden out-of-pocket expense if you are injured or sick. to certain limits. if everyone in the group uses up every penny they can use, the premium would increase for everyone. so, the big idea behind group insurance is that you will be okay if an unexpected health problem occurs. i am not trying to dissuade people from using their benefits, it's just that they are not *really* free, like it seems many people percieve.",Reddit,2023/3/2 20:19,health insurance,"so, the thing about group $T$ is that it is a weird kind of insurance because some of the benefits are optional"
