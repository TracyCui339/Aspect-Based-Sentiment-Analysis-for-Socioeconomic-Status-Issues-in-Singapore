what constitutes the $T$ income?generally, and please correct me if i'm wrong, the ndp policies are to straight up give money/benifits to the lower income people, that money will first increase prices dramatically, as we've seen during covid, and will need to come from somewhere, canada currently doesn't have many rich people, and they are probably taxed out, taxing them more will likely result in them leaving

 youre living in poverty and its actually potentially damaging to classify these people as middle class because politicians and lawmakers can then claim look how many people are in $T$ (which conjures up connotations of people/families that are able to support themselves with all basic needs and a little extra into their savings) the economy is doing great! this allows them to dodge the problem and let it keep getting worse instead of attempting to be solved because the public doesnt even know the problem exists and the politicians will never admit there is a problem in the first place
